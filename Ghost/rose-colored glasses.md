passage: Galatians 6:7-10

Guess I'm just jaded, guess I'm just numb  
Guess I'm just waiting for the light of morning to come  
Guess I'm just looking for hope that'll make my stone heart sing  
Watch for tomorrow to see what it brings  
In rose-colored glasses, I can't see a thing  
  
Tell me there's more, tell me there's something more than hollow-hearted  
Happy thoughts and clever quotes to cling to  
Show me there's more, show me there's hope in all the darkness  
My rose-colored glasses can't see through  
They tell me "be positive," as if that'll help  
I say I'm an optimist but I'm fooling myself  
Show me Your promises, show me we win  
'Cause wearing these glasses, I can't see a thing  
In rose-colored glasses, I can't see a thing  
  
_For the one who sows to his own flesh  
Will from the flesh reap corruption  
But the one who sows to the Spirit  
Will from the Spirit reap eternal life_  
  
Guess being human is all that it took  
To learn life's an ocean and it goes down way deeper than it looks  
Guess that I know that the eventide isn't as long as it seems  
But I doubt that tomorrow will help anything  
'Cause in rose-colored glasses, I can't see a thing  
  
_Do not be deceived, God is not mocked  
For whatever one sows, that will he also reap_  
  
And that's where I am when a gentle voice says  
"Don't become weary, you'll heal in due season"  
Drowning the panic inside of my head  
"Don't become weary and keep on believing"  
  
There's more, believe that there's something more than hollow-hearted  
Happy thoughts and clever quotes to cling to  
Promise there's more, promise there's hope in all the darkness  
My rose-colored glasses can't see through  
Tell me there's more, tell me there's something more than hollow-hearted  
Happy thoughts and clever quotes to cling to  
Show me there's more, show me there's hope in all the darkness  
My rose-colored glasses can't see through  
They tell me "be positive," as if that'll help  
I say I'm an optimist but I'm fooling myself  
Show me Your promises, show me we win  
'Cause wearing these glasses, I can't see a thing  
  
In rose-colored glasses, I can't see a thing  
In rose-colored glasses, I can't see a thing
