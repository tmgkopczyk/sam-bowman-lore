passage: 2 Corinthians 10:5

_I hear a whisper in the corner of my mind_  
  
Fool you once, fool you twice  
Lure you out and strike you blind  
What you want, what you need  
What you crave to feel complete  
Darkened eyes, heart of stone  
We don't fight with flesh and blood  
We don't fight with flesh and blood  
  
The night is long while I wait for light of dawn  
  
I hear a whisper in the corner of my mind  
In the corner of my mind  
In the corner of my mind  
I see a specter in the corner of my eye  
In the corner of my eye  
In the corner of my eye  
There's a weeping willow wailing in the breeze  
I can hear it in the trees  
Hear it calling out to me  
Calling out to me  
  
_(What you thinking?)  
(What you thinking?)  
(Let me tell ya)_  
Calling out to me  
_(What you thinking?)  
(What you thinking?)  
(Let me tell ya)_  
(_Calling out to-_)  
  
Fool me once, fool me twice  
Is it virtue, is it vice?  
Empty thoughts, vain designs  
Everyone will bow to Christ  
Darkened eyes, heart of stone  
I don't fight with flesh and blood  
I don't fight with flesh and blood  
  
The night is long but I know where I belong  
  
There's a whisper in the corner of my mind  
In the corner of my mind  
In the corner of my mind (In the corner of my mind)  
I see a specter in the corner of my eye  
In the corner of my eye  
In the corner of my eye (In the corner of my eye)  
There's a weeping willow wailing in the breeze  
I can hear it in the trees  
Hear it calling out to me  
Calling out to me  
  
_(What you thinking?)  
(What you thinking?)  
(Let me tell ya)_  
Calling out to me  
_(What you thinking?)  
(What you thinking?)  
(Let me tell ya)  
(Let me tell ya)  
  
(What you thinking?)  
(What you thinking?)  
(Let me tell ya)_  
Calling out to me  
_(What you thinking?)  
(What you thinking?)  
(Let me tell ya)_
