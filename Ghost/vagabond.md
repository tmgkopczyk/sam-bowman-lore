I'm fine  
Just tired of all the sleepless nights  
And tireder of believing lies  
I'm begging You to be my guide  
'Cause I  
  
Don't want to settle for a place that's not my home  
Don't want to listen to the fables told by ghosts  
Know that there's nothing good down this hopeless road  
Don't wanna settle for a place  
I'm just a vagabond wandering 'round  
'Til You call me home  
  
They say  
Not everybody wandering's lost  
With no idea of where they are  
Won't You be my Northern Star?  
'Cause I  
  
Don't want to settle for a place that's not my home  
Don't want to listen to the fables told by ghosts  
Know that there's nothing good down this hopeless road  
Don't wanna settle for a place  
I'm just a vagabond wandering 'round  
'Til You call me home  
  
_'Til You call me home  
'Til You call me home  
'Til You call me home  
'Til You call me home  
'Til You call me home  
'Til You call me home  
'Til You call me home_  
  
At night I lie beneath the stars  
The day's been long, the road's been hard  
Remind me where my hope belongs  
'Cause You are the way back, You are the way back  
Life's a journey everybody's gotta make  
The fight, the hurt, the love, the pain  
Deep down I know I'll be okay  
'Cause You are the way back  
  
Don't want to settle for a place that's not my home  
Don't want to listen to the fables told by ghosts  
_Know that there's nothing good down this hopeless road  
Don't wanna settle for a place  
I'm just a vagabond wandering 'round  
'Til You call me home_  
  
I've been looking to the left, to the right, tell me  
You are the way back, You are the way back  
I've been looking to the left, to the right, tell me (You call me home)  
Vagabond wandering 'round 'til You call me home  
You call me home
