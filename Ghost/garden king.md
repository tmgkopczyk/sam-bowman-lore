passage: Daniel 4:34-35

Let me tell you the tale of a tree that could cover the land in its shade  
Its branches were broad as could be and they offered benevolent rule  
The birds in the sky and the beasts on the ground found a place they could stay  
But listen close to the mighty tree, it was singing that ancient tune  
  
"Who on earth is as mighty as I can be?  
Who on earth has the power to stand against my will?"  
Then the men took the axe and cut down the tree  
And they bound up the stump amidst the grass of the field  
(And everybody said)  
  
Eon to eon, You are King  
Conquering ruler of everything  
Armies of heaven, hosts of men  
No one among them can stay Your hand  
Armies of heaven, hosts of men  
No one among them can stay Your hand  
  
Let me tell you the tale of a king that commanded the men of the earth  
As he scornfully laughed to himself, looking out from the palace roof  
On the nations and cities he raided and ravaged and razed to the dirt  
But listen close to the Garden King, he was singing that ancient tune  
  
"Who on earth is as mighty as I can be?  
Who on earth has the power to stand against my will?"  
  
Let me tell you the tale of a beast that was driven from all that he loved  
With the talons of eagles, he grazed like an ox in the morning dew  
Seven years came and went 'til he lifted his voice to the heavens above  
Listen close to the lowly beast, he was singing a different tune  
  
"Who on earth is as mighty as Adonai?  
Who on earth has the power to stand against His will?"  
Jesus humbles the proud and exalts the lowly  
All His judgments are true, and He's merciful still  
(And everybody said)  
  
Eon to eon, You are King  
Conquering ruler of everything  
Armies of heaven, hosts of men  
No one among them can stay Your hand  
Armies of heaven, hosts of men  
No one among them can stay Your hand  
No one among them can stay Your hand
