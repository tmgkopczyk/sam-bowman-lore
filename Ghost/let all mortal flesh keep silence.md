passage: Zechariah 2:13
---
Let all mortal flesh keep silence  
And with fear and trembling stand  
Ponder nothing earthly-minded  
For with blessing in His hand  
Christ our God to earth descending  
Comes our homage to command  
  
King of Kings yet born of Mary  
As of old on earth, He stood  
Lord of Lords in human likeness  
In the body and the blood  
He will give to all the faithful  
His own self of heavenly food  
  
Rank on rank, the host of heaven  
Spreads its vanguard on the way  
As light from light descending  
From the realms of endless day  
That the powers of hell may vanquish  
As the darkness clears away  
Clear the way  
Clear the way  
Clear the way  
  
At His feet, the six-winged seraph  
Cherubim with sleepless eye  
Veil their faces to the Presence  
As with ceaseless voice they cry  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Lord most high  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Lord most high
