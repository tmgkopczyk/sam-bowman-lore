You still make beauty from ashes  
You still make peace out of tragedy  
You make my heart come alive  
Come alive  
  
Flash back to the old man's chains  
To the cold and shame  
'Til You called my name  
Flashback to the ancient spark  
Overcame the dark  
And sustained my heart  
  
I don't want to trade love for a lie  
And smother the fire inside  
  
'Cause I've been fighting phantoms  
Tryin' to blind my eyes  
So won't You fan the flame  
To keep my hope alive  
  
Woke up in an ice-cold sweat  
To a nightmare's end  
Thought the ghosts were friends  
Woke up to a legion strong  
To a fiendish throng  
Can't sleep  
  
'Cause I've been fighting phantoms  
Tryin' to blind my eyes  
So won't You fan the flame  
To keep my hope alive  
  
In the joy, in the pain (_Still burning_)  
In the seasons of chaos and change (_Still burning_)  
In a nation confused (_Still burning_)  
We're the ones that rejoice in the truth (_Still burning_)  
We are dead to the flesh (_Still burning_)  
To to that sick fill of goods that the ghosts wanna sell (_Still burning_)  
We are carried by light (_Still burning_)  
We believe in the promise that Christ is enough (_Still burning_)  
  
And we don't wanna trade love for a lie  
And smother the fire inside  
  
'Cause I've been fighting phantoms  
Tryin' to blind my eyes  
So won't You fan the flame  
To keep my hope alive (_Still burning_)  
  
Fighting  
Fighting  
Fighting  
Fighting  
  
Burn us down, we won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Burn us down, we won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Burn us down, we won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Won't burn out, won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Burn us down, we won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Burn us down, we won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Burn us down, we won't burn out (_Still burning_)  
Won't burn out, won't burn out (_Still burning_)
