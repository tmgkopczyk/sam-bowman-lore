Beneath the windowsill  
Of the house my ego built  
Is a worn and weathered splinter in the wall  
And that's where the vines sneak in  
Intertwining with my desire and sin  
They strangle the life I live  
They're defiling and undermining it  
Somehow I decided that  
All my righteousness would suffice for me  
I can't reconcile with  
What's refining and what's entitlement  
  
Can anyone set me free  
From the thorns that fetter me?  
'Cause the bitterest roots run deep  
Run deep, they run deep  
  
And I only hope I'm wrong  
That it's flourished here this long  
'Cause I drove it underground (Hah-ah, hah-ah)  
Would You clear away the vines  
That imprison me inside?  
Help me see a truth that's deeper than the roots go  
  
Beneath my peace of mind  
Underneath my fear inside  
Is a cynical denial of the truth  
And that's where the vines sneak in  
Intertwining with my desire and sin  
They whisper the lie that built  
The confinement that I am pining in  
Why am I running?  
Tell me, what am I running from?  
Is it the person I'm becoming  
Or is it what's beneath the rug?  
  
Like Icarus' threadbare wings  
Like Babylon's selfish king  
The bitterest roots run deep  
Run deep, they run deep  
  
And I only hope I'm wrong  
That it's flourished here this long  
'Cause I drove it underground (Hah-ah, hah-ah)  
Would You clear away the vines  
That imprison me inside?  
Help me see a truth that's deeper than the roots go  
  
(Hah-ah, hah-ah)  
Would You clear away the vines  
That imprison me inside?  
Help me see a truth that's deeper than the roots go  
Help me see a truth that's deeper than the roots go
