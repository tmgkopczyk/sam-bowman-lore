I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing  
  
Woke up to the same dream I picture every night (Night)  
I just wanna know that it's gonna be alright  
'Cause my heart's been heavy lately  
'Cause my head's been going crazy  
Chasing after wind that'll never satisfy  
  
You go before me, You go behind  
You took my heart and gave it a song inside  
And it goes a little something like this  
  
I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing (I ain't worried about a thing)  
  
I've been anxious about tomorrow  
But that isn't worth my sorrow  
You tell me to be still and to know that You are God  
  
You go before me, You go behind  
You took my heart and gave it a song inside  
And it goes a little something like this  
  
I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing (I ain't worried about a thing)  
I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing (I ain't worried about a thing)  
  
Hold on to me (Hold on to me)  
Holding on to You (Holding on to You)  
Your will is sure (Your will is sure)  
Your Word is true (Your Word is true)  
Hold on to me (Hold on to me)  
Holding on to You (Holding on to You)  
Your will is sure (Your will is sure)  
Your Word is true  
  
I ain't worried about a thing (Hold on to me)  
I ain't worried about a thing (Holding on to You)  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing (I ain't worried about a thing)  
I ain't worried about a thing (Hold on to me)  
I ain't worried about a thing (Holding on to You)  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing (I ain't worried about a thing)  
  
I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
I ain't worried about a thing  
Because I know my King's sovereign over everything  
I ain't worried about a thing
