I've been feeling pretty high-strung lately  
Remember when I could run without a care in the world?  
I've been fighting off the phantoms daily  
Wish I could put down my phone so they would leave me alone  
I've been lookin' out the window waitin'  
But now I'm headed outside to stop the war in my mind  
  
I'm tired, I'm so bone-tired of solo flyin' tonight  
  
I need to escape from the world I created  
Love it or hate it, I'm dyin' inside  
Give me a break from this digital cage, yeah  
Sooner or later, I'm losin' my mind  
Make me a tree bearing fruit in its season  
Help me to see that there's more to my life  
Than the likes on my posts, on my phone  
At my desk, all alone  
'Cause I can't go one more day  
Without a breath of fresh air  
  
Clock in, clock out  
It's such a vicious cycle now  
Log in, log out  
I'm stuck here wishing for the dopamine hit  
For the hope in all this  
While I totally miss the truth  
  
I'm tired, I'm so bone-tired of solo flying tonight  
  
I need to escape from the world I created  
Love it or hate it, I'm dyin' inside (Dyin' inside)  
Give me a break from this digital cage, yeah  
Sooner or later, I'm losin' my mind (Losin' my mind)  
Make me a tree bearing fruit in its season  
Help me to see that there's more to my life  
Than the likes on my posts, on my phone  
At my desk, all alone  
'Cause I can't go one more day  
Without a breath of fresh air  
  
_'Cause I can't go one more day  
One more day, one more day  
'Cause I can't go one more day  
One more day, more day  
'Cause I can't go one more day  
One more day, one more day  
'Cause I can't go one more day_  
  
Make me a tree bearing fruit in its season  
Help me to see that there's more to delight in than voices of ghosts  
_(Go past this line, believe in yourself, follow your heart)_  
God, I can't go one more day  
Without a breath of fresh air
