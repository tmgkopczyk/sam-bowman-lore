I'd like to tell you a story  
The story is old and it's new  
It's about ghosts and ghouls  
Desperation and doom and darkening gloom  
And conquering good and redemption that's sure  
It's about me and it's about you  
Most importantly, it's about a Savior who makes broken things new  
And I'll tell you a secret: this story is true  
So find a place to get comfortable  
And I'll share it with you  
  
This story started in a garden that was haunted by grace  
Lovingly formed by the Ancient of Days  
From eon to eon it exalted the Sovereign  
Who reigned as benevolent ruler and author  
The rocks would exclaim  
The willows, cry out  
The stars would proclaim  
And the mountains would shout  
And by the coast, you could hear oceans roaring  
That Yahweh is worthy of honor and glory  
But you want to know the best part?  
It wasn't the rocks or the trees or the stars or the seas  
No, it was His magnum opus: His image-bearers  
God bent down to the Earth and created His bride  
From dust from the ground and a bone from man's side  
Rose Adam and Eve as they walked with God Himself  
What a shock!  
Here was the Sovereign of all as the Imminent One  
He was Yahweh-Shammah and at once, ʼĒl ʻElyōn  
Eternally peerless, forever transcendent  
But our first parents could stand in God's presence  
Haunted by holiness, haunted by grace  
As they walked in the garden in the light of God's face  
And everything was good  
Very good, in fact  
Until one day the couple received a visitor  
An apparition, if you will  
Fallen from Heaven itself  
  
The wraith of all wraiths slithered up to the woman  
And convinced her that ultimately, she was missing something  
And with a bite of an apple, she and the man  
Rejected communion and rejected God's plan  
That's when the ghosts arrived, brazen and bold  
Spawn of their father, that serpent of old  
They were sired and raised by the lies that he told  
And our first parents took the bait that day  
It was insidious sin that killed them within  
Scoffing at truth that was given to them  
And believing that lie that deceives you and I  
"Forget God and the garden, His presence and light  
Because I like it better when I do what I want  
When I leave God behind to follow my own heart  
Who cares if my real God's my belly  
And who cares if I chase after suitors that wither away"  
And these ghosts, they have a point when they surface and say  
"Who said you need dead words to show you the way?  
Come follow your heart, trust in your feelings  
Comfort on Earth is your best hope of healing  
Why look for a truth when there's no truth to find?  
Why live as a pilgrim? You've got all the time in the world  
To be healthy and happy and wise," said the ghosts  
Said the whispers in the corners of their minds  
  
I'm the narrator, for crying out loud  
And even I have been guilty  
Of exchanging God's truth for a lie  
I've clung to the ghosts to show me the way  
When it comes to the things that I love or I hate  
Or how I can be popular or powerful or wise  
How I can be charming in blind beggars' eyes  
And it's not just the ghosts, but my own desires  
Are how I can be duped into believing these liars  
In my flesh, in the depths of my soul  
I'm opposed to the Spirit and everything precious He holds  
And what a horror! Now I need them, I want them to speak  
The clamor inside gives me sickening peace  
The louder they get, the more I'm distracted  
From the loss, from the suffering I try and push back  
To the edge of my mind  
Anything to escape a heartfelt encounter of conviction or grace  
I'd rather anesthetize sanctified fear  
And fall asleep to the voices that scream in my ear  
  
And the ghosts would continue accosting God's children  
As our thoughts underneath turn depravedly wicked  
The Law would cry out, and the prophets would plead  
But we stiffened our necks and refused to concede  
So a cadaverous pallor hung over our hearts  
As our minds went insane and our eyes became dark  
And God, brokenhearted by His adulterous bride  
Loved her enough to fulfill her desires  
By giving us manna that we ate 'till we died  
By giving us passions that we relished in pride  
By giving us over to debasement of mind  
Never tempting, ever patient, ever loving and kind  
He was slow to His anger but not compromising  
And provided His mercy when His people had tried it  
Haunted by holiness, haunted by grace  
God had no choice but to pour out His rage  
On rebellious men who had shaken their fists  
At the Lord of the Galaxies because they knew best  
On self-righteous people; more like self-righteous specks  
Compared to the righteousness that God represents  
Do you hear it? That's the trumpet  
And it's screaming like a banshee  
As all of Heaven's armies stand firm at the ready  
Called to the mountains and called to the cliffs  
Before holy justice plummets onto your sin  
  
But Heaven is silent  
Because from the very beginning, none of this was a surprise to God  
He knew of the ghosts, He knew of the lies  
He knew of the sin that would kill us inside  
So from Adam to Noah, from Abraham to Moses, from David to Joseph  
He had laid a plan  
How would He expel the lies?  
The Truth  
But we call the Truth another name  
We call Him Jesus  
  
The Son of Man, the Word become flesh  
Came to live among those doomed by death  
He claimed to be a temple and heavenly food  
Saying "I am the Way, and the Life, and the Truth"  
Now this sort of talk doesn't make friends with ghosts  
They only hated His people because they hated Him most  
They writhed in dismay when after 40 days of hunger  
He artfully thwarted the wiles of their master  
So they flew to the ears of the pompous and proud  
To the ears of the treasonous, troubled by doubt  
30 pieces of silver was a high enough offer  
For men seeking Truth to condemn Truth's very author  
  
And so it was that on a cross, straining to breathe  
Hung the bloodstained Hero that you and I need  
Haunted by holiness, haunted by grace  
Christ gave His life while God averted His gaze  
  
The ghosts cackled with glee  
They heard that it was done  
But what "it is finished" meant was not that they had won  
No, in giving His life, Christ gave us ours  
And as He rose three days later, he also gave us power  
In His triumph over death, temptation, and sin  
He gave His children the strength to resist the ghosts within  
He restored us to God and atoned for our souls  
He sent us the Holy Ghost that convicts and consoles  
I know times will be hard, there'll be days I fall short  
I may lose battles, but Christ won the war  
I have more to rely on than positive thinking  
Because His true will and True Word is enough for me to cling to  
And that isn't all because Christ comes again  
To renew what is broken by deception and sin  
The ghosts will dissolve along with their lies  
As the faithful and true King of Kings claims His bride  
  
So this story ends in a garden that's haunted by grace  
As God's people rejoice in the light of His face  
They're free from the ghosts and forgiven of sin  
Forever and always, amen and amen  
  
The end, that's the story  
Thanks for your time  
I hope that in light of all these things you see why  
I was burdened to tell you so much about our minds  
Because I believe Scripture's true  
Forget all the lies that approach you so meekly like sheep in disguise  
My heart is rekindled, now my mind is restored  
My life is a Holy Ghost story now  
And in Christ, so is yours  
The war has been won but the battle remains  
We live in a world full of chaos and pain  
But how will we find the courage to fight?  
Well that, my friend, is a story for another time
