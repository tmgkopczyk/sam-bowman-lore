Can you hear the voices begging you to listen to their call?  
Can you hear the sirens daring you to crash upon the rocks?  
Can you hear the Spirit pleading for the weakness of your heart?  
Can you hear the Savior bidding you to come and bring your cross?  
  
_Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength  
Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, –ind, –i-i-ind  
Love the Lord your God with all your mind, –ind  
Love the Lord with all your mind, –i-i-i-i-i  
Love with all your mind, all your mind, all your mind, all your mind, mind, mind, –ind, –ind, –ind-ind-ind-ind-ind_  
  
_Whisper in the corner of my mind, in the c-c-c-corner of my mi-i-i-i-i-_
