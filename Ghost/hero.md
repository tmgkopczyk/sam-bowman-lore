passage: Psalm 118:8-9

You know that I hate to be wrong  
And I fake being strong sometimes  
You know that I hate going off  
On the same old problems time after time  
  
I always looked for a hero  
Noble and fearless  
Someone to "show me how Jesus loves"  
Always wanted an idol  
A shadow to hide in  
Away from the fear of messing up  
  
It's a bird, it's a plane, could it be?  
The hero we all need  
The hero we all need (The hero we all need)  
It's a bird, it's a plane, could it be?  
What no one else could be  
What no one else could be  
The hero we all need  
  
The hero we all need  
  
I was surrounded by phantoms  
That laughed at my failure to stand  
Until I was found by the Champion  
That valiantly raised me with His righteous right hand  
  
I always looked for a hero  
Noble and fearless  
But nobody loves me like Jesus does  
He is greater than idols  
A refuge to hide in  
He is my strength and my cornerstone  
  
It's a bird, it's a plane, could it be?  
The hero we all need  
The hero we all need (The hero we all need)  
I called His name and He came, set me free  
What can mortals do to me?  
What can mortals do to me?  
  
The hero we all need  
Hero we all need, yeah  
Hero we all need  
The hero we all need  
  
I called His name and He came, set me free  
What other hero could I need?
