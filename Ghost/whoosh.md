My head is spinning 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round  
And I can't slow it down, it down, it down, it down  
My head is in the clouds, the clouds, the clouds, the clouds  
Can someone hold me down, me down, me down, down, down?  
  
(Whoosh) I've been feelin' low, tryin' to let it go  
Wish I could've known the sky was 'bout to fall down  
(Whoosh) Don't know what to say, would it matter anyway?  
I don't know what it would change now  
I like to call myself a sober-minded kinda guy  
But psych! Here comes a fresh explosion, take me for a ride  
It's like a Super Saiyan Uber saying, "listen to the ghosts  
They can help you cope, it's your only hope"  
  
Lowkey, my emotions are a puny god to serve  
Drove me to a place where I could cover up the hurt  
Show me that the fight that I'm fighting's worth  
The time it takes to fall apart  
  
Drownin' in the mist, not perplexed but I'm punch-drunk  
I can't comprehend if it's blessing or dumb luck  
Pendulum mood swinging, genuine blues singing  
Genesis doomed me to desperate truth-seeking  
Heaven-sent fruit speaks, there's more to staying humble than it seems  
Terra firma bears a burden everybody feels  
Watch out for the pride, watch out for the way it lies  
Anno domini vibes in my mind's eye  
  
My head is spinning 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round  
And I can't slow it down, it down, it down, it down  
My head is in the clouds, the clouds, the clouds, the clouds  
Can someone hold me down, me down, me down, down, down?  
  
Would you take my darkest fears?  
Would you stay here  
While I'm in the clouds, the clouds, the clouds, the clouds?  
Can someone hold me down, me down, me down, down, down?  
  
(Hey, can you help me find my keys?)  
Head is on a swivel in the middle of the rat race  
Pedal to the metal but I'm mentally in last place  
Gunning for the star power, thrust me to the start  
But how would strummin' this guitar, how would toppin' all the charts  
How would runnin' from the past, from the last laugh  
Runnin' from the flashbacks that I laugh at satisfy my heart?  
Couldn't get me what I want, I wasn't on my guard  
I'm tired of the dark, I'm going, going, gone  
  
Lowkey, my emotions are a puny god to serve  
Drove me to a place where I could cover up the hurt  
Show me that the fight that I'm fighting's worth  
The time it takes to fall apart  
  
My head is spinning 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round  
And I can't slow it down, it down, it down, it down  
My head is in the clouds, the clouds, the clouds, the clouds  
Can someone hold me down, me down, me down, down, down?  
  
Would you take my darkest fears?  
Would you stay here  
While I'm in the clouds, the clouds, the clouds, the clouds?  
Can someone hold me down, me down, me down, down, down?  
  
(Whoosh)  
(Whoosh)  
_Bye house, I'll miss you_
