passage: Romans 7:21-25

I don't wanna live this way no more  
Nothin' was right when I do what's wrong  
It's a warzone in my mind  
With the ghosts that live inside  
And I don't know what I'm fighting for  
  
I hear You came to bleed and die  
To give me everlasting life  
  
I don't do what I like  
And I don't like what I do  
You know I wanna do right  
And then I wander from You  
Jesus, keep me from sin  
That wants to kill me within  
And believe in that same old lie  
That vintage vice  
  
_I don't do what I like  
And I don't like what I do  
You know I wanna do right  
And then I wander from You_  
Jesus, keep me from sin  
That wants to kill me within  
And believe in that same old lie  
  
I don't wanna function in the stress  
Caught between spirit and my flesh (Yeah)  
It's a warzone in my mind  
With the ghosts that live inside  
Can anyone save me from this body of death?  
  
I hear You bid me "come and die"  
To give me everlasting life  
  
I don't do what I like  
And I don't like what I do  
You know I wanna do right  
And then I wander from You  
Jesus, keep me from sin  
That wants to kill me within  
And believe in that same old lie  
That vintage vice  
  
_I don't do what I like  
And_ I don't like what I do  
You know I wanna do right  
_And then I wander from You_ (Wander from You)  
Jesus, keep me from sin  
That wants to kill me within  
And believe in that same old lie
