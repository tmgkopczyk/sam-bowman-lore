Hello, it's me, it's been a while since we've spoken  
Times have been so hard for us both and  
So many voices out there are pulling us apart (Pulling us apart)  
I was thinking about you Monday, I just thought I'd let you know  
I get that so much changed for us a couple weeks ago  
And I know that it's been hard to keep hanging on (Hanging on)  
  
We're all worlds apart  
But I hold you in my heart  
Whether you're near or far  
We don't have to feel lonely  
We're hidden in His love  
Our bond was bought by blood  
Lift your head because  
We don't have to feel  
  
And when it all falls down  
All we know burns to the ground  
We all say as one  
We don't have to feel lonely  
(We don't have to feel lonely)  
(We don't have to feel lonely)  
  
Tell me I'm a fool, but it feels like  
Battle lines were drawn here between us  
Distance and fighting and twisting and spiting  
Have split us and broken us down  
_No matter what they say, no matter what they do  
None of it can hinder me from holding on to you  
We're family and nothing's gonna change that now_  
  
We're all worlds apart  
But I hold you in my heart  
Whether you're near or far  
We don't have to feel lonely  
We're hidden in His love  
Our bond was bought by blood  
Lift your head because  
We don't have to feel  
  
And when it all falls down  
All we know burns to the ground  
We all say as one  
We don't have to feel lonely  
(We don't have to feel lonely)  
(We don't have to feel lonely)  
When it all falls down  
  
We're all worlds apart  
But I hold you in my heart  
Whether you're near or far  
We don't have to feel lonely  
We're hidden in His love  
Our bond was bought by blood  
Lift your head because  
We don't have to feel  
(Lonely, woah)  
(Lonely, yeah, yeah)  
(Lonely, ooh, ooh)  
(Lonely)  
Yeah, we don't have to feel
