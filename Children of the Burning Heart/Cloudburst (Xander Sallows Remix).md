Wake up tired in the morning  
But here's to one more day alive  
Look outside and it's pouring  
But in the end, the sun will shine  
And walking through life is a whirlwind  
The storm is raging deep inside  
Still smile when it's hurting  
I've got this joy I can't deny  
  
Look up when it looks down  
Hold onto the hope that you got now  
When the thunder starts and the sky goes dark  
Watch the light come bursting through the clouds  
Look up when it looks down  
This life is a gift that you got now  
When the thunder starts and the sky goes dark  
Watch the light come bursting through the clouds  
  
Working overtime on the weekend  
The stress begins to take control  
But I feel so strong when I'm weakest  
This song won't stop inside my soul  
  
Look up when it looks down  
Hold onto the hope that you got now  
When the thunder starts and the sky goes dark  
Watch the light come bursting through the clouds  
Look up when it looks down  
This life is a gift that you got now  
When the thunder starts and the sky goes dark  
Watch the light come bursting through the clouds  
  
I was living in the torrent I call home, so low  
I was living inundated by sorrow, God knows  
Bravado makes a lame umbrella  
I know that pride won't keep me dry forever  
I know today is a day I can lift up my face  
And praise the Maker for His perfect grace, so bring the rain  
  
Look up when it looks down  
Hold onto the hope that you got now  
When the thunder starts and the sky goes dark  
Watch the light come bursting through the clouds  
Look up when it looks down  
This life is a gift that you got now  
When the thunder starts and the sky goes dark  
Watch the light come bursting through the clouds
