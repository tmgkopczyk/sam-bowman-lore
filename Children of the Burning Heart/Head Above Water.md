Tossed and turned by waves and wind  
I'm coming up to breathe again  
Lightning flashes, thunder rolls  
Watch for the undertow  
  
Wave after wave tries to pull me under  
But my eyes are fixed on Your face  
I know I'm safe and sound  
Day after day You are faithful  
To hold my head above the waves  
Wave after wave tries to pull me under  
But my eyes are fixed on Your face  
I know I'm safe and sound  
Day after day You are faithful  
To hold my head above the waves  
  
_Wa-a-ave after, pull me under  
Pull me under, pull me under  
Wa-a-ave after, but my eyes  
I know I'm safe and, safe and sound  
Wa-a-ave after, pull me under  
Pull me under, pull me under  
Wa-a-ave after, but my eyes  
I know I'm safe and, safe and sound_  
  
They found Him sleeping starboard side  
Where was the spark of faith inside?  
Lightning flashed, the thunder rolled  
The King shut down the storm  
  
Wave after wave tries to pull me under  
But my eyes are fixed on Your face  
I know I'm safe and sound  
Day after day You are faithful  
To hold my head above the waves  
Wave after wave tries to pull me under  
But my eyes are fixed on Your face  
I know I'm safe and sound  
Day after day You are faithful  
To hold my head above the waves  
  
_Wa-a-ave after, pull me under  
Pull me under, pull me under  
Wa-a-ave after, but my eyes  
I know I'm safe and, safe and sound  
Wa-a-ave after, pull me under  
Pull me under, pull me under  
Wa-a-ave after, but my eyes  
I know I'm safe and, safe and sound_
