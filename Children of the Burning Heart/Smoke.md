I never thought it'd be this hard to fuel the fire  
A flaming beacon shining through the dark of night  
I never thought it'd be this hard to say goodbye  
To all the things I thought would keep my soul alight  
  
My story isn't over, but I've reached this chapter's end  
And I don't have a notion as to how to start again  
When the rain falls down, and my soul pours out  
And the flame within me's burning down  
It's oh, so hard for my trembling heart  
To hold to hope as it all goes up in smoke  
  
I never thought it'd be this hard to find my way  
Seeking, searching in this lonesome world of gray  
My lantern only lights so far beyond the place I stand  
To guide me past the treacherous chasms of this unknown land  
  
When the rain falls down, and my soul pours out  
And my roadmap's gone, and I'm feeling lost  
I try to see what's in front of me  
In a nameless land and all I see is smoke  
  
So tell me why I feel an overwhelming peace  
Tell me why I feel a fullness in my need  
From life to life, from death to death I trust Him for His grace  
Behind a frowning providence, He hides a smiling face  
  
When the rain falls down, and my soul pours out  
I'm burning down, but I won't burn out  
I'll testify with my worn heart's cry  
Jesus, may my life go up in smoke
