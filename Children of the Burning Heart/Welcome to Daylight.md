Your eyes are a window to your soul  
And I can see that worldly fears are fighting for control  
Your hands have borne a heavy load  
And I can say a desperate heart's too much to bear alone  
  
The story isn't over  
The morning's drawing closer  
  
_Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to_  
  
Your soul was kindled by His grace  
Sovereign mercy lit the spark that set your heart ablaze  
All around, the world is waking up  
Rescued by the Father's love  
This land of darkness sees the light of dawn  
  
_Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to_  

_Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Eye, your eyes are a window to  
Your eyes, your eyes are, eyes are  
Your eyes are a window to_  
  
_The story isn't over  
The morning's drawing closer_
