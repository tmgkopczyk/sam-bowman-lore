He spent all his days in a tower looking over the oceanside  
He learned from his father, the Maker, with admiring eyes open wide  
Watching the birds as they soared through the sky  
He longed for their freedom 'til one passing by  
Flew up to the window and said  
  
Come fly away with me, I can show you the world  
A world at your feet  
Come fly away with me, I can give you the sky  
And make you the king  
Climb higher, climb higher  
There ain't no coming down  
There ain't no coming down  
  
_Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher_  
  
He stepped into darkness from light to rescue those that He treasured  
He wandered the desert alone to heed the will of His Father  
Watching the kingdoms He knew He must save  
The tempter of old that leads nations astray  
Crept up right beside Him and said  
  
Come fly away with me, I can grant You the world  
And all of its kings  
Come fly away with me, I can give You the sky  
If You'll fall at my feet  
Climb higher, climb higher  
There ain't no coming down  
There ain't no coming down  
  
_Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher  
Climb higher_
