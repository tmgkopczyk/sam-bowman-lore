You are my refuge  
You are my fortress  
God in whom I trust  
I make my dwelling  
Under Your shadow  
Guarded by Your love  
  
When the sickness stalks  
And the arrows flies  
And the terror haunts you in the night  
When the lions roar  
And the serpents writhe  
And a thousand men fall at your side  
  
Brother, cling to the One who holds you  
Brother, call to the One who knows you  
You'll find your peace  
Under His wings  
  
Brother, cling to the One who holds you  
Brother, call to the One who knows you  
You'll find your peace  
Under His wings

You'll find your peace  
Under His wings  
  
When the sickness stalks  
And the arrows flies  
And the terror haunts you in the night  
When the lions roar  
And the serpents ride  
And a thousand men fall at your side  
  
Brother, cling to the One who holds you  
Brother, call to the One who knows you  
You'll find your peace  
Under His wings
