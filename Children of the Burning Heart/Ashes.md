Maybe you feel something like what I do  
Maybe feeling that your strength is gone  
Weary of the dark  
Tired of the night  
Ready for the dawn  
  
We crash and burn, we come undone  
Our hearts are sore and the world is groaning  
The flame inside has nearly died  
We cannot see, but we keep on hoping  
You make beauty from ashes  
You make peace out of tragedy  
You make my heart come alive, come alive  
  
Do you know the chapter that we read now  
Isn't worth comparing to the end?  
The glory that we'll see  
Who could comprehend?  
  
All creation longs to see our freedom  
We are children of the burning heart  
We're weary of the dark  
Tired of the night  
Waiting for the dawn  
  
We crash and burn, we come undone  
Our hearts are sore and the world is groaning  
The flame inside has nearly died  
We cannot see, but we keep on hoping  
You make beauty from ashes  
You make peace out of tragedy  
You make my heart come alive, come alive  
  
We crash and burn, we come undone  
Our hearts are sore and the world is groaning  
The flame inside has nearly died  
We cannot see, but we keep on hoping  
You make beauty from ashes  
You make peace out of tragedy  
You make my heart come alive, come alive, come alive
