I wonder if you're still the same  
As when I saw you last  
The memories that we made  
Are hidden in the past  
Years go by, time passes on  
We get older and we move on  
And it doesn't feel the same  
  
Tell me, tell me, that there's something I can do  
To bridge the chasm that sequesters me from you  
I miss you, I wish you were here  
  
I wonder how you've been  
I wonder how you are  
Have the things you've been through quenched  
The fire inside your heart?  
Years go by, time passes on  
We get older and we move on  
And we forget each other's names  
  
Tell me, tell me, that there's something I can do  
To bridge the chasm that sequesters me from you  
I miss you, I wish you were here  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
_Tell me, tell me, that there's something I can do  
To bridge the chasm that sequesters me from you  
I miss you  
I miss you_
