Empires fall, kingdoms shatter  
And we must do the same  
  
Take a blink and you won't find me here  
Take a breath and I'll disappear  
Like a mist in the air  
  
It hurts so much, my love  
To look into your eyes and see despair  
There's no hope there (_There's no hope_)  
Do you know that when tomorrow brings me home  
I'm not undone  
My story's just begun  

I am shattered, feeling small  
Numbering my days  
  
Take a blink and you won't find me here  
Take a breath and I'll disappear  
I am dust on the breeze  
  
So take a breath, my love  
And then lift up your eyes and see the cross  
Where darkness lost (_Where darkâ€”_)  
We both know until tomorrow brings us home  
We're not afraid  
We're not afraid  
  
We're not afraid, yeah
