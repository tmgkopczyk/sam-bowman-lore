When all of this is over  
I will look into your eyes  
And see the flame that burns inside you hasn't died  
When all of this is over  
We can look from where we've come  
And see the beauty in the hardships of the road  
  
When all of this is over  
We will hold each other close  
Because the course we've taken shows us  
That our bond's what matters most  
And now we're drawing closer  
To the day our journey's done  
And we can rest in thankful silence  
Cause we know the battle's done  
  
When all of this is over  
What is dark will be pierced with light  
And everything that wrong will be made right  
When all of this is over  
We will stand before a throne  
And be ushered into our forever home  
  
When all of this is over  
We can see with unveiled face  
The One who came to die and live again  
To freely offer grace  
And now we're drawing closer  
To the day our journey's done  
And we can rest in thankful silence  
Cause we know the battle's done
