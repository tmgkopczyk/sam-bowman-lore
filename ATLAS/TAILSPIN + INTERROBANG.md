A time for silence, a time to speak
A time for violence, a time for peace
A time to live and a time to die
A time to fall and a time to fly
A time for questions, a time for answers
A time for tension, a time for tangents
A time to measure how much time I have
A time to see I'm running out, and

Everything's changing
Except all the changes
And it doesn't make sense
I'm in a tailspin

Listen, I'll be honest
I don't wanna rock the boat 'cause the boat rocks back
I don't wanna put my hope in a lost cause
Brag about tomorrow acting like I'm gonna make it that far
But I'm lost in the process
Spinning around and around in the cosmos
And my stomach is in my throat
And my lungs are filling with smoke
Lord knows I've surrendered to the hevel too long
(Spinning 'round and 'round and 'round)
I got a bogey on my nine, bogey on my nine
Bogey on me tryna blow me out the sky
Rolling with the crisis inside
Nosedive on an island and drown it in the silence
Crying it's piously violent
But all I'm after is to finally prove
I'm not accountable to gravity 'cause I get to choose
But I'm afflicted by the switches of the rhythm
I'm a victim of the physics that imprison me too

Everything's changing
Except all the changes
And it doesn't make sense
I'm in a tailspin

It's easy to believe I've seen it all by now
Defeated by a grief I've made a home in now
I'll deal with the upheaval 'til time runs out
Time runs out
Tell me I'm not alone
And that you hear the voices too
Thought I conquered the ghosts
But they lie in the walls of my childhood bedroom
Trying to get through
And every now and then I let 'em
And I listen to the lies of the phantoms
When my heart is a kerosene jar
And my head is a pressure bomb
Gotta find the strength not to set it off

Everything's changing
Except all the changes
And it doesn't make sense
I'm in a tailspin

My head is spinning 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And I can't slow it down, it down, it down, it down
My head is spinning 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And I can't slow it down, it down, it down, it down

Vanity, vanity
Everything under the sun
Is vanity, can it be
Everything's already been done
All of my work, all of my time
Just to forget a forgettable prize
And I gotta leave it for some other guy when I die—vanity
My head is spinning around and around and around
Like McConaughey's hanging in space
I'm overthinking all my overthinking
And I'm over thinking that habit's okay
I know I'm winning but smiling and grinning and wishing
Ain't kicking the phantoms away
They haven't gone anywhere—vanity (Vanity)
I got a relevant sentiment
And I've been feeling it ever since "Legend of Max"
I got a revenant regiment
Spreading deception about how the Ghost Story ends
But I wanna wrestle the nebula
Best it and fit it inside of the palm of my hand
I don't understand—vanity (Vanity)
Listen (Interrobang)
I got a cardiac arsonist
Always bombarding my conscience with fire and smoke
But I still argue the quandary
Whether the progress around me is mine or the Lord's
I wanna carry my cross and the cosmos
And logically posit that I can do both
I ain't afraid of the ghost
I ain't afraid of the ghost (Interrobang)
But I'm scared of their questions
Scared of the chance I'll answer 'em wrong
Scared of the mess I'll unleash if I'm dreading and sleepless
And stressing and sweeping 'em under the rug
Scared of the future, scared of the past
Scared of the moments I'll wanna take back
Scared if I'm not scared enough
I will lose the control of the planets I hold in my hand
Tell me who's really Atlas
I hold the tension, You hold the planets
I wanna help but You say You'll manage
I am dependent, You are my Sabbath
You're in the heavens, I'm in a panic
You're omnipresent, I'm an asthmatic
I want the method, You are the madness
I am the question, You are the answer
