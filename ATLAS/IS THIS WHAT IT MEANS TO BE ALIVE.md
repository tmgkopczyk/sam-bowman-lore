There's so much I don't understand
But I'm learning the purpose of man
Is to love You and do what You say
Everything is vanity under the sun
But the height and the depth of Your love
Will always be more than enough

Strengthen my innermost being
With power that comes from Your spirit
Give me the strength to believe in
A love that transcends my dimension

There's so much I don't understand
But I'm learning the purpose of man
Is to love You and do what You say
Everything is vanity under the sun
But the height and the depth of Your love
Will always be more than enough

Is it really healing if my heart still feels poisoned?
Is it really grieving if there's joy in the morning?
Is it really believing if I brace for disappointment?
What is this? Is this what it means to be alive?
Can I preach the Gospel when I know how much I need it?
Can I make disciples when my mind is this depleted?
Can I let the joy of Jesus be the strength within my weakness?
What is this? Is this what it means to be alive?
To be alive, to be braver, to be bolder
To be strong even if I'm weeping on Your shoulder
Even if I can't stop shoving this boulder
Up this hill that doesn't end
Torn apart again by polar opposite tensions
What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?
Man, I've had it with the lies
And I'm bewildered by the truth
I have never been more tired
And I've never been more resolute
I'm older and wiser
And hopelessly confused
And alive
And it's all because of Jesus I'm alive
And it's all for Jesus' glory I'm alive
And that's why it's such a gift to be alive
This is what it means to be alive
And in Your hands

'Cause my heart is in Your hands
Even if I'll never understand
You've got the whole world in Your hands
You've got the whole world in Your hands
