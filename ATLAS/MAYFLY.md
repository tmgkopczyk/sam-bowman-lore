Mayfly on my bedroom wall
You'll be dead and gone, just give it a day or two
The same fate's coming for us all
So I guess we're not that different, me and you
And that's what's funny about life
Sink or swim, you're losing time
But I'm stuck here on this island
Terrified to move

Then I spiral
Vicious cycle

What if the sky falls down around me?
I can't hold up the sun
And what if the rising waters drown me?
An ocean in my lungs
If I jump out the plane, the landing could paralyze me
But what if it doesn't?
And what if it doesn't hurt to try?

Lying around thinking about times to come
Dreaming of routes to other towns but I'm stuck here, yeah
What if I ventured out of my head?
Take up my life, shoot for the sky
But I'm scared of all my unknown prospects

What if the sky falls down around me?
I can't hold up the sun
And what if the rising waters drown me?
An ocean in my lungs
If I jump out the plane, the landing could paralyze me
But what if it doesn't?
And what if it doesn't hurt to try?

We may laugh, we may cry
We may quit, we may try
We may live, we may die
We may fall, we may fly

(Just tell me)

What if the sky falls down around me?
I can't hold up the sun
And what if the rising waters drown me?
An ocean in my lungs
If I jump out the plane, the landing could paralyze me
But what if it doesn't?
Tell me, what if it doesn't?

We may laugh, we may cry
We may quit, we may try
We may live, we may die
We may fall, we may fly
