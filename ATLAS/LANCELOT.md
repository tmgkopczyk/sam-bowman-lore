Noble, fearless
Knight in shining armor
Stoic, peerless
Fighting for your honor
That's all they know
What if they looked farther?
That's all they know

I gotta be braver, I gotta be bolder
And carry their fates on my shoulders
(The hero we all need)

I wasn't the hero they needed
But only the one they deserved

Foxhunts, firebrands
Choices made in madness
Jawbones, triumphs
Riddles in an ambush
How could they know (How could they know?)
My sacrilegious passion?
How could they know? (How could they know?)

I gotta be braver, I gotta be bolder
And carry those gates on my shoulders
(The hero we all need)

I wasn't the hero they needed
But only the one they deserved

Treason, vengeance
Mercenaries bind me
Pleading, desperate
For mercy shown to blind men
Be my penance
Will You set me free?
Be my strength in me

'Cause You are the hero they needed
And I was the one they deserved
It wasn't my strength, but my weakness
That crumbled this temple to dust

It wasn't my strength, but my weakness
That showed them where victory comes from
