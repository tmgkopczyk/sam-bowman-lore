My brain is moving faster than I can type, so I'm sorry

They tell me I'm down to earth
I wish I were, it's been a blur
Solving the mysteries in the sky
They tell me to take a breath
Escape the stress, don't have the strength
To conquer the phantoms in my mind

If everything's for You and before You
And You hold them together
Does "everything" mean the cosmos
When they're on my shoulders?

Falling faster into dawn and shadow
And I almost had it figured out
This is how it hurts us
Spinning around in circles
I need Your love to hold me down
I need Your love to hold me down

He is the image of the invisible God, firstborn over all creation

They tell me You made all things
Creation sings, domains and kings
Regardless if I see or not (See or not)
They tell me that You're the head
Preeminent, You raise the dead
And reconcile them by Your blood

If everything's for You and before You
And You hold them together
Does "everything" mean the cosmos
That I make my problem?

Falling faster into dawn and shadow
And I thought I had it figured out
This is how it hurts us
Spinning around in circles
I need Your love to hold me down
I need Your love to hold me down

Suddenly I see the burden's not on me
To keep the sky from crashing down

Falling faster into dawn and shadow
And I almost had it figured out
(Figured out, figured out, fi-fi-figured out)
This is how it hurts us
Spinning around in circles
I need Your love to hold me down
(I need Your love to hold me down)
I need Your love to hold me down
Can You hold me down?
