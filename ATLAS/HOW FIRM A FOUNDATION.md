How firm a foundation, you saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
What more can be said than to you He has said
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled

"Fear not, I am with you, O be not dismayed
For I am your God, and will still give you aid
I'll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand"

Cause you to stand, cause you to stand
Cause you to stand, cause you to stand

"When through fiery trials your pathway shall lie
My grace, all sufficient, will be your supply
The flame will not hurt you; I only design
Your dross to consume, and your gold to refine"

"The soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose
I will not, I will not desert to its foes
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake"

Never forsake, never forsake
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake
I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake

Cause you to stand, cause you to stand
Cause you to stand, cause you to stand

How firm a foundation, you saints of the Lord
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word
