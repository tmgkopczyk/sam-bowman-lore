Where do I go from here?
What do I call this feeling?
Help me to find its meaning

It starts as a knot in my chest
I can't sleep, I can't rest
I just need to escape it
I need to get angry
To make it obey me
I don't want to lose control
Now I'm arguing louder and louder
To no one exactly
To gather momentum
To gather the strength
That'll help me to make it
I don't want to lose control

But when push comes to shove, I'm frozen in place
And I look at a world that's floating in space
And I look at Your love, a cosmic embrace
I'm amazed

If I swung back and forth inside of my brain
Just to muster the force that could force away the pain
That could force it all to make sense
If I only could, you know I would
Does the raging of man earn the goodness of God?
Can I make the demand You improve on Your promise?
I hate that my answer is usually yes, I'll confess

But I'll start tying knots in my chest
I can't sleep, I can't rest
I just need to convince you
Whoever is listening
My insights are better
I don't want to lose control
Now I'm falling faster
Around of the edge of the planet
To gather momentum
To gather the strength
That'll help me to make it
I don't want to lose control

But when push comes to shove, I'm frozen in place
And I look at a world that's floating in space
And I look at Your love, a cosmic embrace
I'm amazed

Do I trust You're enough to comfort my soul?
To adjust to the rush of losing control
When I'm under the sun and over-emotional

Inhale, exhale slow
I'm not in control
Peace be still my soul
Peace be still my soul
Inhale, exhale slow
I'm not in control
Lay the cosmos down
Inhale, exhale slow
I'm not in control
Peace be still my soul
Peace be still my soul
Inhale, exhale slow
I'm not in control
Lay the cosmos down
Lay the cosmos down
