Smoke
All of it is smoke
Formless and vapid, ungraspably vain
What did we profit, what did we gain?
Smoke, it's all smoke
Generations come, and generations go
The sun rises and falls and resets
Just like the stars and the seas and the winds
And we're tired—more than our words can express
Is there anything down here of which can be said
"Look, this is new. What a groundbreaking thing!"
Because what has been is what will be
And it's smoke

Welcome to Undersun—that's just how it is here
We can't help it, this is our home
We're carried by forces we cannot control
We're stuck on a planet that's revolving through space
Victims of physics, at the mercy of fate
"What's the point?" I said to myself with a sigh
"We're born just to live a few years and then die?"
"What do people on Undersun actually do?"
I'd answer those questions, or at least attempt to
For starters, I needed to find a career
So I took a job as a low-income sound engineer
And I made a few friends, I formed a routine
But I found myself bothered by polar extremes
Not between "good" and "bad", but between "good" and "best"
For example, was I made for work or for rest?
Should I speak honestly, or just keep the peace?
Can I feel confident without feeling conceited?
Should I seek independence, or rely on my friends?
Should I welcome new thoughts, or keep close to the chest?
Should I live for approval, or just be myself?
"Both!" said the culture. "Sure hope that helps!"
That didn't help, if that wasn't clear
I get I need both, but how much of each?
And on top of all that, I'm especially fatigued
By the need to conceal my emotions, yet feel them
And that's heavy, honestly; I wish it weren't so
But maybe that's how things on Undersun go
I'm new to all this; I just turned 24
And I haven't solved the world's problems before

"But I guess as a Christian, I'm called to... a lot"
I don't know if I understood that or not
But bearing the weight of those tensions within
Was like bearing the weight of the cosmos themselves
But I wouldn't admit it, I wouldn't succumb
To the spiraling circle my mind had become
I had to be braver and stronger and bolder
I had to carry the stars on my shoulders
I'm fine with the burden of polarized planets
Of sobering questions and baffling answers
Of grief unresolved, of futures unknown
Of following my self-imposed ethical code
Of "stewarding my talents for others to see"
Of learning what on earth that remark even means
Of controlling my destiny just long enough
To make life feel purposeful under the sun

Because I was Atlas, so I was convinced
A power-drunk Titan endowed with the strength
To seal the divine into Pandora's box
Assuming God's thoughts were the same as my own
Because now I was braver and stronger and bolder
Resting providence's work on my shoulders
But I wasn't suited for that kind of burden
My heart and mind knew that; my hands had to learn it
My joints began to buckle and crack
From the weight of the cosmos I'd placed on my back
I shifted my balance in an attempt to suppress
The sensation that I was in over my head
To my horror, I found myself losing my grasp
On the galaxy I thought was mine to command
But no, I thought, I'd be fine on my own
I could carry the stars, and I'd do it alone

But my thoughts were derailed by the deafening crash
Of Orion descending and crumbling to ash
And the seismic collision of Venus and Mars
Fractured my confidence that I was in charge
And as Neptune careened out of orbit above
I knew I was losing the world that I loved
But gravity wins, and it comes for us all
And the sky that I shouldered was destined to fall
If all of the planets would just stay in place
If all of the cosmos would simply behave
If all of my questions and tensions within
Would align themselves so I could make them make sense
If I could convince you my heart was unfazed
By grieving or longing or suffering or change
If I could be braver and stronger and bolder
If I could carry the world on my—

I can't
I just can't
I thought I could. I tried. But I can't. I'm so sorry
I thought carrying this weight was the right thing to do
But I sinned against God, and I sinned against you
I'm free from the ghosts, right? I live in the truth
But in my pride, I thought holding the stars was the proof
And it was all smoke
But someone has to hold it together
Who could carry in one hand the burden of fate
And hold in the other my sanctification?
Who could stand in the tension between heaven and earth?
"Take heart," says a voice that's quiet but sure
"I have overcome the world"

Jesus of Nazareth, the God-Man Himself
Descended to Undersun and took on our flesh
He alone perfectly loved and obeyed
While perfectly holding the cosmos in place
And ascending a cross, hung between earth and sky
He'd pay the full price for your sin and mine
With galaxy-shouldering arms stretched wide
He raised His head, said, "It's finished!" and died
But that's not the end, 'cause that Sunday, He'd rise
Defeating our sin and bringing us life
And that's good news, sure; but what about now?
There's practical stuff that I've gotta nail down
And that was the part that I misunderstood
When I grappled the cosmos, I thought strength was found
In having this Undersun stuff figured out
But friend, true strength is found in the height and the length
And the width and the depth of His love

Love defies all of Undersun's maxims and laws
Go figure—'cause Jesus' thoughts aren't like ours
Love fills us with all of the fullness of God
And gives us the courage to bear our own cross
Listen, don't miss this—God doesn't need help
He invented the fabric of spacetime itself
But obedience in the mundane, or simple, or boring
Is bearing our cross as God makes us holy
It's more than a spiritual band-aid to hide
My questions and cares and afflictions behind
This is faith, it's orbit, it's tension in motion
Entrusting my purpose to Someone who loves me
And knowing that even as victims of physics
Jesus is powerfully working within us
And now that you're grounded in infinite love
Lay down the planets, and pick up your cross

Pick it up when the questions of life are too great
For our finite and limited minds to explain
Pick it up when wandering the circles of grief
Strikes at the heart of your deepest beliefs
Pick it up when the slanderer spits in your face
Because you aren't the Hero, and they need His grace
Pick it up when you're hopeless and chained to your bed
Trusting that God isn't done with you yet
Pick it up when the strangers Christ settles nearby
Strengthen your courage and shatter your pride
Pick it up when in love, they take hold of your hand
And widen your circle to let others in
Pick it up when the treacherous tempests of time
Mean leaving a season you treasure behind
Pick it up when your circumstance captures your thoughts
Because duties are ours, and events are the Lord's
Pick it up when the vanity under the sun
Tempts you to question omnipotent love
Pick it up when you realize you're not in control
And it feels like you're falling, or flying, or both
Pick it up when the phantoms haunting your mind
Threaten to smother the fire inside
Pick it up in Christ's strength, child of the King
Leave all resulting; do the next thing

Lay down the cosmos, they're out of your hands
Just follow Him closely, believing you can
And I know that you can, 'cause of what Christ has done
As you're rooted and grounded in love
Now, to the young, I'm talking specifically to you
Will you remember that love in the days of your youth?
When life is confusing, and choices are hard
And you're tempted to carry the weight of the world
Please consider the One who already does
And to all of us, the end of the matter is plain
Love Jesus most and do what He says
Your purpose is found in no more and no less
And that's the legend of Atlas, of strength not my own
That carries the stars and comforts my soul
It's a paradox, friend, that I hope you can see
Alone, we can't be strong; but in Christ, we can't be weak

And one day, he'll free us from Undersun's plight
He'll dry every tear and make everything right
And He'll come to claim His bride
She'll have a flame inside
She'll be unstained by lies
She'll rest in ancient might
And she will be clothed in white
