I'ma be honest, I'm sick of the stress
Sick of trying to measure up to everybody else
Tired of fighting, don't know where I stand
I'm just trying to find out who/what/where I am

I'ma be honest, I'm all out of words
Can't cleverly say something you've not already heard
I reach in the chaos and pull out a key
I toss it in the sea, but it's not that deep

I made friends with condescension
Flew on waxen wings
Tried, but never reached the heavens
You've persuaded me

If I had You in a box
In a little tiny box
You would up and blow the top off its hinges
I trapped You in my thoughts
But Your thoughts are not my thoughts
And I wasn't strong enough to contain them
And now my perception's upside down
My sense of direction is turned around
I've been lost in my thoughts
But my thoughts are not Your thoughts
Can You break open the box that I'm caged in?

(I wish someone would tell me more about boxes)

Boxes are tidy, boxes are clean
Boxes help when I don't know what all this nonsense means
But maybe there's purpose under the sun
You're the only one that knows what nonsense can become
And maybe all this nonsense can be fun
It's only nonsense 'cause I said it was
You fashioned all this nonsense out of love
I'm embracing it because

I tried, but never reached the heavens
You've persuaded me

If I had You in a box
In a little tiny box
You would up and blow the top off its hinges
I trapped You in my thoughts
But Your thoughts are not my thoughts
And I wasn't strong enough to contain them
And now my perception's upside down (Upside down)
My sense of direction is turned around
I've been lost in my thoughts
But my thoughts are not Your thoughts
Can You break open the box that I'm caged in?

I've been lost in my thoughts
But my thoughts are not Your thoughts
