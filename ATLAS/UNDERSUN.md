I'm at a loss for words for once (Vanit—all is vani—)
I've been walking circles, now I'm back where I've begun (A generation goes, and a generation—)
I chased the wind until my wisdom turned to madness
And my bliss gave way to sadness
But that's the way things happen on Undersun
(All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it)

Tell me all that time, all that struggling
Was worth something in the end
Tell me all that pain had a meaning
'Cause I can't see it in the end

If home is where the heart is
My house is burning down
There are ashes in the carpet
And phantoms all around
I built a homemade rocket
In our childhood backyard
And I never expected
That it would bring us out this far
So they made the moon our target
To land among the stars
Now we're all out of college
And we don't know where we are

Tell me all that time, all that struggling (Tell me all that time)
Was worth something in the end
Tell me all that pain had a meaning (Tell me all that pain)
Cause I can't see it in the end

I wanna be strong enough to grasp
Tendrils of smoke with both of my hands
But everyone knows I can't
You know I can't
But even in vanity below
Help me allow myself to hope
There's a reason for the grieving
I can't see it, but there's a meaning
There's a meaning

Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Tell me all that time, all that struggling
Was worth something in the end
Tell me all this pain has a meaning
I can't bear it, but You can

Vanity of vanities, says the preacher
Vanity of vanities, all is vani—
