You wouldn't be the first to say
That we'd all be better off without him
The crooked king turned his face
To the idols of mountains and valleys
But then the enemy saw an advantage
And sent menacing armies southward
It was a perilous problem to handle
But listen to the wicked king say

But everybody else can do it
Medicate any way they might choose
So dedicate anything Judah can offer the godless
Because we know better now

So I'll pray to the gods of Damascus
As a way I can stop the disaster
'Cause the world just won't make sense
And if this works, it works, I guess

Pray to the—pray to the gods of Damascus
Way I can s—way—if this works, it works, I guess

You wouldn't be the first to say
It's exhausting to roll with the punches
To gather up the force it takes
To absorb the pain and injustice
But it's the predicament victims of physics exist in
Grimly predictable rhythm
Admit that I'm sick of the guilt but
I'm sicker of the sickness and this is gonna fix it

So I'll pray to the gods of Damascus
As a way I can stop the disaster
'Cause the world just won't make sense
And if this works, it works, I guess
So I'll pray to the gods of Damascus
As a way I can process the panic
'Cause the world just won't make sense
And if this works, it works, I guess

If I'm honest, I'm way too pragmatic
To sit and rot while I wait for an answer
So I promise I'm able to manage
With all of my shameful distractions
And plus, it supposedly worked for the other guys
It made 'em social, assertive, and numb inside
But they're alone and they're burdened, and so am I
Hope it was worth all the compromise
It's the original treason of Ahaz
'Cause I didn't just cheat my Creator
But my sin only deepened the anguish within
Would You grant me repentance?
'Cause I could shoulder the cross or the planets
But there's only one solace in madness
And it won't be the gods of Damascus
It won't be the gods of Damascus

So I'll pray to the—pray to the gods of Damascus
Way I can s—way I can stop the disaster
Pray to the—pray to the gods of Damascus
Gods of Damascus, gods of Damascus
(I don't know where you are)
Pray to the—pray to the gods of Damascus
Way I can s—way I can—
(I don't know where, I don't know where, I don't)
Pray to the—pray I can stop the disaster
Stop the disaster, stop the disaster
(I don't know where you are)
