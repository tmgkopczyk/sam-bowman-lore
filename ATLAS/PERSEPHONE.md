(I don't know where you are)

She lived underneath the ground
Way beneath the continents' roots (I don't know where you are)
Until every spring, she found
Herself free from her netherworld tomb (I don't know, I don't know)

But everyone scattered
Whenever she happened to come around
The cosmos were spinning out
And it had to be somebody's fault
But she said

Every summer ends
Promise you that gravity always wins
You just wanna plan how the planet spins
And make it my fault that you can't, my fault that you can't
Seasons are part of life
He makes everything beautiful in time
You just wanna reach up and hold the sky
And make it my fault that you can't, my fault that you can't

All these changes, you're so afraid that
You can't explain 'em

(I don't know where you are)

I heard that an eye for an eye
Can reliably promise me rest (I don't know where you are)
But other than blinding some guy
I've kinda put God in my debt (I don't know, I don't know)

How will I manage if baffling tragedy
Jacks with the balance I cannot contain?
But the cosmos are spinning out
And I'm looking for someone to blame

Every summer ends
Promise you that gravity always wins
You just wanna plan how the planet spins
And make it my fault that you can't, my fault that you can't
Seasons are part of life
He makes everything beautiful in time
You just wanna reach up and hold the sky
And make it my fault that you can't, my fault that you can't

There's a time for war, a time for peace
A time for love, a time for grief
A time to regret it
A time to live, a time to die
A time to fall, a time to fly
A time to accept that
The time I have is time to see
That time does not belong to me
Help me surrender

All these changes, you're so afraid that
You can't explain 'em

She vanished beneath the ground
And abruptly the summer was gone (I don't know where you are)
And everyone looked around
As they wondered what she'd done (I don't know, I don't know)
