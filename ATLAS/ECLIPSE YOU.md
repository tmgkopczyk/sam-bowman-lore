(Too much)

We're on a wheel spinning in orbit
Looking for hope in the motion we're lost in
We want a real grip on the cosmos
We're sick of the symptoms and stuck on the causes

So I'll try to explain it
Straining to rein in the stars
(Look how far away they are)
(Can I reach that far?)
I can hold up the planets
But I'm spinning around and around and around and around
And around and around and around
Can You hold me down?

Because I'm falling and I'm flying both at once
I'm locked in a cosmic game of tug of war
Read between the lines, reason with the sky
'Til my hope is gone, and I wonder what I struggle for
I'll try and convince You (How did I get here?)
I can do what I wish to (Did You forget me?)
But the planets eclipse You (The planets eclipse You)
The planets eclipse You

(Day two: we're stranded)

It was hard enough to graduate college
Now we're looking for jobs and routines and apartments
And being twenty-something is hard when
You're entangled in tensions and questions and options

But I promise I'll make it
Straining to rein in the stars
(Am I doing this right?)
(Get a handle on my life)
I'll put Your thoughts in a box
Because I'm spinning around and around and around and around
And around and around and around
Can You hold me down?

Push 'n' pulling looking for a
Fulcrum I can fall or fly from
Diving finding spiral cycles
Buy the lie that I'm a Titan
Motion, tension, four dimensions
Beg the question, just a second
Overkill on Undersun is gonna rip me limb from limb

Because I'm falling and I'm flying both at once
I'm locked in a cosmic game of tug of war
Read between the lines, screaming to the sky
'Til my hope is gone, and I wonder what I struggle for
I'll try and convince You (How did I get here?)
I can do what I wish to (Did You forget me?)
But the planets eclipse You (The planets eclipse You)
The planets eclipse You

Look up to the master motion of the first wheel
Let us be faithful and care for our own part
Which is to do and suffer for him
And lay Christ's part on himself and leave it there
Duties are ours, events are the Lord's
