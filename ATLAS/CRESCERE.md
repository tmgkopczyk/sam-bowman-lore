I'm tired of striving and spiraling
Over and over again
'Cause since time out of mind I've been trying
To hold up the cosmos within

Two are better than one working under the sun
Would you hold me up if I fall?
You've got fire inside in the coldest of nights
Will you keep me warm?

And then you put your hand in mine
Then pull me back to make the circle wider, and wider
This is who we are now
Can't deny
The One who holds the planets has aligned us
This is who we are
And then you put your hand in mine
Then pull me back to make the circle wider, and wider
This is who we are now
Can't deny
The One who holds the planets has aligned us
This is who we are

What does it mean to make a friend
That'll stick around when
I'm overwhelmed with chasing wind?
I know I can't hold up the sky
Maybe a threefold cord can try
Maybe I needed to rely on the strength I don't have

Two are better than one working under the sun
Would you hold me up if I fall?
You've got fire inside in the coldest of nights
Would you keep me warm?

And then you put your hand in mine
And pull me back to make the circle wider, and wider
This is who we are now
Can't deny
The One who holds the planets has aligned us
This is who we are

Thought I was better off alone
But you took me as your own
And you made my circle wider, and wider, and wider, and wider
And wider, and wider, and wider, and wider
And wider, and wider, and wider, and wider
And wider, and wider, and wider

And then you put your hand in mine
And pull me back to make the circle wider, and wider
This is who we are now
Can't deny
The One who holds the planets has aligned us
This is who we are
(Then you put yourâ€”)

Two are better than one working under the sun
