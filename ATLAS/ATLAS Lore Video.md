# INTRO
When I sat down a couple years ago to start studying for this record, Scripture made one thing clear to me. Alone, I can't be strong. But in Christ, I can't be weak. Now, that's quite the paradox we've got here. How do you write an album about strength when you're convinced you can't be strong? And how do you write about weakness when you're convinced you can't be weak? There's a tension there. A tension between heaven's strength and my own. In Greek mythology, Atlas the Titan was doomed to carry the weight of the cosmos on his shoulders forever. And there's that tension again, carrying heaven's weight when that wasn't his purpose. Just like Atlas, I want to rule the tension between heaven and earth, but I can't and I'll never be able to. And I wrote 20 songs about that. 

But you guys still want to know more. 

Which, I'll be honest, kind of blows me away. You guys got stuff to do. You got lives to live. But you had questions about how these songs came around. You want to hear about all the ways they connect to each other. You want to know the lore, and that's what this video is for. Friend, pull up a chair, grab a snack or a drink if you'd like to, and let's dive in. My name is Sam Bowman, and these are the stories and secrets behind my third studio album, Atlas. I hope you enjoy it.

# PETRICHOR / CIRCLES
Google says that petrichor is a pleasant smell that frequently accompanies the first rain after a long period of warm, dry weather. My last album, Ghost, ended with a 10-minute long spoken word. It was a thunderstorm after a dry season. It was truth after struggling with so much deception. And sure, yeah, there's sweetness that comes with that truth, but now it's time to pick up the pieces. That's why I named Atlas's intro PETRICHOR. Now, this piano line right here, this melody shows up all over the record. It's like in Star Wars when Darth Vader walks in and hear that little da da da kind of melody that lets you know he's there. The musical term for that is leitmotif. This piano melody right here symbolizes the theme of the album. Tension. Tension between our responsibility and God's sovereignty. Both of those things are important for us to believe in. But how do we live in the tension in the meantime? That's what ATLAS is all about. There is one more fun thing here. Check out this little voice clip after the crescendo. Now, where have we heard that one before? You love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. Where my first album, Children of the Burning Heart, was about the heart. And my second album, Ghost, was about the mind. Atlas is about our strength. How do we love the Lord our God with all our strength? What does that even mean?  Now, I hadn't really duct-taped songs to each other like this before, but PETRICHOR flows right into CIRCLES, which flows right into ECLIPSE YOU, which flows right into PANDORA, and it keeps going for a minute. 

CIRCLES sets up the visual theme of the record. Told from the perspective of somebody in space that would really prefer not to be in space. He isn't grounded, and he wants to be. In his own power, he tried to escape gravity, and now he regrets doing that, which is very mysterious. He also says that he's falling in circles, which is a vague thing to say. I know it's a surprise tool that'll help us later. Just stay tuned.

Oh, I almost forgot. This is kind of neat. There's a little voice at the end. That's just me and my friends watching the actual uh solar eclipse in 2024, which of course leads us right into

# ECLIPSE YOU
This song was inspired by the quote that you hear at the very end. Samuel Rutherford was a Scottish theologian that said:

> "Do not focus your thoughts among the confused wheels of secondary causes, as -'O if this had been, this had not followed!' Look up to the master motion of the first wheel. 

then he talks about building and gardening for a little while. At the end of the quote he says:

> Let us be faithful and care for our own part, which is to do and suffer for him, and lay Christ's part on himself and leave it there; duties are ours, events are the Lord's."

Y'all I get so distracted with those secondary causes. Not the invisible stuff, but the visible stuff, good stuff, career stuff, house stuff, family stuff, friendship stuff, and all of the ways that stuff can explode. I'm protective of those things before they explode. And I'm listless once they inevitably do. I want to answer all of the existential questions those things bring up, so I don't need help. I want to control my circumstances so I don't hurt.

And all that is especially tempting in your 20s. ATLAS is written for everyone, but it's especially sensitive to folks in their 20s. We'll talk more about Ecclesiastes later, but that book especially emphasizes how important it is to understand these truths while you're young. ATLAS has the same heart. 

In the midst of all of those questions that it's so difficult to answer, how do we survive, let alone thrive without letting those questions eclipse our view of a loving, kind savior?
# PANDORA'S BOX (feat. Matthew Parker)
When I was little, we used to sing the song in church that went, "If I had Jesus in a little bitty box".

Am I the only one that knows this song? Am I crazy?

And look, I didn't have a robust view of the sovereignty of God at the time. I was like six. But I thought it was dumb. "Jesus ain't fitting in my box". 

But like I want to put Christ in a box in my mind.

I want to believe that I have all the answers and I understand how everything works. Everything including him. But his thoughts are not my thoughts. His ways are not my ways. He is knowable but he is not completely understandable. There's always going to be something I don't understand. And for the pessimist, that is good news. For the tired, for the weary, that's good news. You need to know that you don't have it all figured out. 

A lot of you liked hearing this reference to Icarus that ended up here: "If I'm assuming that I understand enough to do things my way, putting God in a box in the corner of my mind, then how am I any better off than he was?" He thought he knew better, too. And look what happened to him. It's the same story. 

Oh, yeah. Matthew Parker's here. Look, he makes the whole song better. That's kind of what he does. There's that part ... in the verse ... where he talks about the key, and the chaos, and the ocean and stuff and a lot of you are like, "What does this mean?" 

And the answer is nothing. 

But, we thought it'd be funny to put in a part that just didn't mean anything. So, yeah, it's quite literally not that deep. 

In the original version of this song, there was Morse code in this break here in the chorus that spelled out decoy. Well, that was in reference to my EP, Legend Of Max. Its track list would end up spelling out Decoy. Well, Max had just come out by the time we were working on this version. So, I just left the space empty and told Matthew to do whatever he wanted with it. And the results speak for themselves.

# GODS OF DAMASCUS
For those of you that grew up on Veggie Tales, this is essentially the bunny song. 

It's stuck in my head, but it's _heresy_. 

This song is about King Ahaz of Judah. You can find the story in your Bible in 2 Chronicles 28. Real short version, instead of asking God to deliver him from his enemies, this king of God's people ended up praying to evil foreign gods and asking them for help instead. Uh, very obscure story.

How does that fit into Atlas? 

I thought it was kind of cool. This song starts with that glitch at the end of Pandora and then a little shut noise. That's Ahaz shutting the box. He's put God in a box. He's fine on his own. We know he's not. 

The real pivot point of the story is his reasoning for why he does what he does. His kingdom gets invaded by the Syrians, but he ends up sacrificing to their gods instead because their gods look like they're winning. This is the first song to mention the phrase victims of physics on Atlas. 

Atlas is a physics album. Spin and twist and fall and fly and all of it. All of that acknowledges that we aren't in control. Stuff happens. How do we live in light of that? Well, Ahaz copes with that by doing what works. Ahaz is a fan of pragmatism. If it works, it works. The problem with that is if God's thoughts aren't our thoughts, and we were just over this in Pandora, how do we even know what works? How do we know that isn't actively making it worse? Ahaz's sin sure made it worse.

What GODS OF DAMASCUS is trying to say is that pragmatism is not the Gospel. No matter how much we try, our human solutions are not going to be able to stop the disaster. We are victims of physics. And that's what somebody else in this record is trying to tell us, too. Oh snap, speaking of
# PERSEPHONE
In Greek mythology, Persephone spent half her time in the overworld and half her time paddleboarding the River Styx. And the rules were simple. When she lived above ground, it was summer. When she lived in the land of the dead, it was winter. 

And that's about all I pulled from that story. 

Now, we look at the Greeks who told the story, and we say, "You silly Greeks. You don't know about the axial tilt of the Earth and the planetary orbital plane, you dorks." And that's kind of what my version of Persephone is saying in this song. She's a little irritated. "This isn't my fault, you Greeks. Why are you blaming all of this on me?" The seasons were going to change whether Persephone was above ground or not. 

But you and I are the same. We blame changing seasons on all kinds of stuff. And sure, sometimes we can trace our consequences back to our actions. It's a good principle. But life just doesn't always work that way. Ecclesiastes 3 says that there's a time for everything under the sun. Sometimes these seasons happen irrespective of our actions. 

Now, please don't get me wrong, our actions are still important. We're talking about that later. But Persephone here really is the voice of karma. It is true that you sow what you reap under the sun. That's a principle, not a promise. We just don't always get what we put in. Not this side of eternity.

Anyway, now speaking of time, you've probably heard a bunch of clock noises on this record. Clock noises, ticking noises, metronome noises. I've thrown them in all over the record. It's a huge theme. That's because no matter what we feel, no matter what we think, time is always ticking. It's unstoppable. And that ought to sober us. 

Oh, also this is a fun part. Uh, the drop melody is just Vivaldi's winter. In a song about being confused about the seasons, I wanted to take a winter melody and make it sound summery, and I hope I pulled it off. 

No, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. This is also kind of fun. There's a really creepy bass vocal in the background of the verses. That's just the bridge to ECLIPSE YOU pitched down. That's also kind of fun. 

Last thing that a lot of you wanted to know was what this little vocal sample meant. Hey, editor, could you play that real quick? 

>I don't know where you are.

It sounds very mysterious. It's Persephone saying literally, "Where is your mind right now? You're trying so hard to control everything that you're driving yourself insane all because you can't accept change." Which is a perfect segue into...

# FLYING DUTCHMAN
This song is about another guy who had a hard time with accepting change. The Flying Dutchman was a mythical pirate ship that sailed right into the path of an oncoming gale. The grizzled old captain in his pride refused to turn back home. He was going to finish his voyage. Dog gone it. 

His fate was accursed to sail forever. I think it's a very creepy story.

But notice here we have more resistance to change. That crusty old pirate was willing to make horrible decisions to stay in control. But where Dutchman pivots from PERSEPHONE is that change isn't just inevitable. But change is okay. 

There's intentionality in change and pain, because Jesus thoughts are not our thoughts just like Pandora said. And only when we acknowledge that that change is good, that's when we'll be able to sail home in peace. 

This is probably as good of a time as any to acknowledge those strings cuz they're everywhere. Strings all over the album. Atlas thinks it's a movie. It's the best and worst thing about this album. It's why there are so many grand, vast, sweeping moments on the record. It's why there's so many connections and themes and motifs. And it's even why the lyric videos are in ultra wide resolution. It was so sweet to get to take this much more serious cinematic approach to a concept record, and I hope it served the theme and message well. 

# UNDERSUN (feat. Graham Jones)
So, you might have noticed how much Atlas leans on the book of Ecclesiastes. This song in particular is heavily based on Ecclesiastes 1, but you can find Ecclesiastes quoted all over this record, and you can even hear little sound bites of that first chapter read during this song. 

We've already talked about some songs that mention the idea of living under the sun. That's another thought from Ecclesiastes. The book says that we experience vanity under the sun. In other words, that just means on the earth, Undersun is the name of the planet Atlas takes place on. Undersun is the name of the planet you and I live on, too. And on Undersun, everything is vanity. 

The second verse of this song is just a bit of a pivot. There are some references to my other two albums here that I think are cool, but it also is very important to the Atlas story. There's that line about the homemade rocket. That's where CIRCLES is being sung from, that rocket. A couple of you asked about these audio transmissions that you could hear at points during the album. Actually, editor, could you play a couple?

So, all of those are actually transmissions sent from that rocket mentioned in Undersun. I thought that was kind of cool. It wouldn't be anything that you would know without me telling you probably, but I thought it was cool. 

Also, huge thanks to my friend Graham Jones for helping me with this track. He elevated the whole experience of this song so well, didn't he? 

One more thing on Undersun. This whole bridge is just vocalizing, no lyrics. That's just a reference to Ecclesiastes 1:8. All things are weariness and no man can utter it. There's nothing else to say here. It's hard to live on Undersun. But we need to believe that because of Christ, there is a meaning and our work is worth something in the end. But how do we do that? Well, we've got to start somewhere.
# WE'RE NOT REALLY STRANGERS (feat. Ben Lawrence)
This song was named after an icebreaker card game that makes me uncomfortable.  It makes me uncomfortable because I don't like being known very much. I don't like depending on people. It's messy. It's risky. 

Jesus has had to gently teach me that I'm not being nearly as smart as I think I'm being when I self-isolate. I'm either going to drown in the sea, that hurt that I walk into when I choose to be open with others, or I'll drown in the silence, that hurt that I walk into when I alienate myself from others. Welcome to Undersun, that's just how it is here. 

There is one really neat moment I wanted to talk to you about. I'm putting the chords for the verses on the screen now. It's essentially a 4-5-2 chord progression, but the bass is in the third of the chord, so it sounds very undecided until the second verse. There, we finally get to the root of the problem we're talking about. My isolation is causing more harm than peace. And when the lyrics can resolve that, the chords resolve along with it and that bass moves back to the root instead of the third. Super super subtle storytelling point, but thought it was cool. Thought you'd be interested.

A lot of you wanted to know about this little laughing sound that shows up right here before the bridge. It gets used a lot on this record. Actually, you know what, editor? 

Yes, that's me laughing. It's there because it represents that ideal experience of joy under the sun. It's also there because Ecclesiastes calls laughter madness. Both of those things can be true in their time. There's tension there and mostly I just think that's kind of interesting. 

Wrapping up STRANGERS, I need to submit to how Jesus might use others to make me stronger. That's his prerogative. It's not mine. And speaking of people around you that are helpful, huge props to Ben Lawrence for practically carrying this song. His presence on it was just so critical and it contributed to that serene, intentional vibe that I was going for here.

# LANCELOT
LANCELOT is another scripture story. "But Lancelot isn't in the Bible!" I know Lancelot isn't in the Bible. Lancelot's a metaphor for another dude who is in the Bible. This story is really about Samson.

Like Lancelot, Samson is a guy that we think of probably in a better light than he deserves. He was a national hero. He was also a hothead and adulterous and rebellious. We know Samson because he was strong, we remember him because he was weak. 

There are some points in this song where you might notice some old sound bites. If you didn't know, these are vocals from my song [[hero]] off of Ghost. Editor, would you mind playing that back?

Now, [[hero]] talked about trusting in other people too much. But man, it's so easy to turn from a false trust in others to a false trust in yourself. And that's not nearly as helpful as it looks like it's going to be, isn't it? 

In other words, if Hero says you can't save me, LANCELOT says I can't save me either. And as a Christian, I have to live in that tension. I don't need others. And yet, I totally do. Because really, at the root of it, I need Christ. And if he wants to use my own weakness to show me, then so be it.

# TAILSPIN / INTERROBANG?!
All right \*clap\*, there's a lot y'all wanted to know about this song. And there are actually quite a lot of ties that I've left in here. What I'm trying to say here is buckle up because for those of y'all who are familiar with my music, this is going to be quite a ride. For those of you who are brand new,

I'm so sorry. 

Now, if you remember, Persephone was the first song on Atlas to use Ecclesiastes 3, a time for everything. Now, we've got our second use of that passage right here. Because there's a time for everything, it's inevitable that we're going to encounter change. Okay, this is a whole rabbit hole. 

So, a lot of you have pointed out that I use a particular sound pretty often. It's made by using what's called low frequency oscillation or LFO. You know what? Editors, just roll the tape.

I call this sound a tailspin and it's essentially become my signature which I think is really funny. I didn't invent this sound.

But all over my discography, I've used it to describe the feeling of being disoriented. It's a sound of trying to get your bearings. And in this song, I can't get those bearings. My head is spinning too fast. 

Oh, hey. That's why we get the vocals from my song [[whoosh]], in this song. That song foreshadowed the sky falling down. The whole thing that, you know, Atlas was trying to keep from happening. In our own strength, we can't do that. And now my head's spinning. And, there's a real sense of mourning that comes with that. Change sucks. Helplessness sucks. We miss the past. And it's hard to know how to express that longing feeling sometimes. 

Oh, hey. That's what the synth line from my song [[Miss You]] is doing here. It's a way to acknowledge that it just sucks on a production note. I could have just tried to recreate the sound or maybe dig up the project from 2021 and get the patch from there or 

Oh, snap. I could just do that. Fine. 

The whole genre switch up, that's just thematic. Everything changes, including the genre for this song. It started out cinematic and solemn. It ended as an alt rock panic attack. We aren't guaranteed consistency under the sun. That's what makes Christ's immutability so precious cuz he don't change. 

But this song doesn't end there. 

This is the second two-parter on Atlas. Interrobang defines what bothers Tailspin so much. We can't stop change. And that causes us to question ourselves, our circumstances, and our purpose. And not only that, but Interrobang points out that we have to be honest when dealing with these existential questions. And nobody hates that more than, 

oh, hey, 

Atlas needs Ghost and Ghost needs Atlas. If you haven't heard my second album, (and if you haven't, I wouldn't blame you cuz where would you get the time?) it's about lies. Lies about who Christ is and who we are. And we believe those lies way too often. Those lies are the ghosts that haunt our minds. Across Ghost, I used the spooky sound of a bowed cymbal to symbolize those lies. I also used this chord progression that showed up a few times on that record. 

The melody from that album's intro, [[can you hear them]], shows up in this interlude between TAILSPIN and INTERROBANG. First, it's that French horn, then the whole brass section joins in, and then that bowed cymbal hits. Then that piano is just the same Ghost riff for about a minute and a half. This song goes fast. We need to go fast, too.  Lightning round for some of these lyrics because we need to move on. 

We got more Ecclesiastes 1 reference. We have references to previous projects that I thought were cool. And right here we have the thesis of the record. This is it. We finally found the crux of the whole question we've spent 10 songs trying to answer. 

It took so much digging, but we're here and we can't fix it. I am the question. Only Jesus can be the answer. How? How is that not a spiritual copout for real life problems? 

And that's what the second half of Atlas is about. INTERROBANG is Atlas's halftime break. I also need a halftime break. I've been talking for a bajillion years. You've been listening for a bajillion years. I need to refill my water. While I do that, I'm going to get editor Sam to talk to you about the artwork for the album cuz some of you had some questions about that. Sound cool? Great. Awesome. I'll be back. 
# HALFTIME (AN ARTWORK DISCUSSION)
Hey everybody, editor Sam here. And yes, I did make Atlas's artwork myself. This little insignia here was made by my brother, who's a huge creative help for all of these records. This insignia is an orbital. See this first planet here whirling around the second one? It's that theme of tension and orbit and circles and weight. And I thought it was nifty and it looks pretty cool on a hat. But yeah, I made the rest. I wanted it to look mysterious and existential and a little solemn. It's like the artwork is trying to, as another song on Atlas says, solve mysteries in the sky, and I think it looks okay. 

A lot of you have been really kind about the art direction for the record, and I really appreciate it. I'm not a graphic designer by any stretch of the imagination, so it's been really kind. Oh, snap. Halftime's over. Y'all want to dive back in? Let's do it.
# TITAN
ATLAS orbits around TITAN. This is the heartbeat of the album. TITAN ties many of ATLAS songs together. There's [[PETRICHOR + CIRCLES|CIRCLES]] language. There's space language. There's under the sun language.

There's a reference to [[PANDORA'S BOX]] here about trying and failing to build a worldview strong enough to predict and control my circumstances. 

This point here about faith being an orbit is really important, and we'll chat about that later. 

There's a moment where this song name checks both of my previous records. And you can see the throughline from my first album to my third one. 

That's why there are all these references to my heart and my mind. That's what my first two albums were about. In Burning Heart, the spirit set our hearts on fire. We had hope in suffering, passion in pressure. In Ghost, that fire inside was put under attack by way of our mind. If suffering could have put out that fire, then maybe lies from the world, the flesh, and the enemy would. 

By the time ATLAS rolls around, I'm older. I'm grown. I'm self-sufficient. I know better now. Instead of the ghosts coming from the outside, I'm the one lying now. Man, I'm lying to myself if I think I can handle my sanctification, my circumstances, my future all on my own, completely unilaterally. In other words, I'm lying to myself if I say I can carry the cosmos along with my cross. 

And that's when everything falls apart. That's when the sky falls. It's when I realized that I never had any control in the first place. I asked for all this mess by trusting in my own strength. And that strength wasn't strong enough. What is strength really? Is it being braver and stronger and bolder in our own effort? No, it can't be. True strength is the spirit-given ability to cling to the height, the length, the width, and the depth of Christ's love. That's enough. I have to believe that. I've never loved anything I've written quite like I've loved Titan. It's sweeping, convoluted, dynamic, wildly personal. Uh, it's my heart on a wave file. Thanks for giving me your time.
# DO THE NEXT THING (feat. Christian Singleton)
So, I did not write the words to this song. Obviously, I think these words are the best on the album in that case, and I needed them a lot. 

The copy for this song comes from a 19th century English poem. The author of the poem was anonymous. In the 20th century, the poem was popularized by Elizabeth Elliot, wife of martyed missionary Jim Elliot. And over time, the poem has become my response to my desire to control my circumstances, my reputation, and my destiny. I can't worry about all of that right now. I have got to leave all resulting. I have got to trust Jesus with tomorrow instead of concerning myself with the weight of the cosmos. I need to do the next thing. 

Also, huge thanks to Christian Singleton for her help with this song. Doing the next thing has a lot of the time just been working on one of Christian's songs. I thought it was sweet to nod to that way that the Lord used her here. 
# IS THIS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE
This song is really blunt. So blunt that there isn't a whole ton to say about this one. Really, this song is about bothness. And so is the album. It's double length for a reason. It talks a ton about tension and opposites and contradiction. And a lot of that talking happens in this song. The song quotes both of the title verses for Atlas.

Now, some of you guys might know that since I'm independent, I can set the copyright label of my releases to be whatever I want it to be, release by release. And for a couple years now, I've set that copyright to be the Scripture that that song pulls from the most. And Atlas is no different. You scroll down and there it is. 

But since Atlas is so interested in bothness, I've left two Scriptures instead of one. The first one is Ecclesiastes 12:13. It's Ecclesiastes, go figure. After all is said and done, all that's left for me is to fear God and obey his commandments. That's it. 

It's to understand that there's no one stronger, kinder, or more beautiful in the universe than him. And it's to know that when he gives me something to do, it's a good thing. But the second one is Ephesians 3:14-21. Not only is God sovereign, but he's loving, more loving than I'm physically able to comprehend, but according to Paul, strength here is that comprehension of his love. I need to be strong enough to understand that Jesus loves me. 

Only then, in the midst of all of this bothness, is my life going to have meaning under the sun. Only then am I going to be able to be mournful and joyful and confident and vulnerable and faithful and truthful and older and wiser and hopelessly confused. I don't understand a whole lot, but I can at least cling to Jesus' love and do what he wants me to do today. And this is what it means to be alive.

# INERTIA (feat. Niyah Marie)
Inertia is a very determined song at first. The past four songs were all very emotional and raw and Inertia wants to go do something. 

And that's good. The problem is when that prechorus gets all loud and busy and angry and then it realizes all that going and doing is easier said than done, isn't it? 

I wrote it that way because I get loud and busy and angry, too. Who would have guessed? 

I'm leading the witness. But the answer isn't to get loud and busy and angry. That might look like it works, but that's an awful lot like Ahaz's story, isn't it? We need to trust Christ for the strength that we need, not our own emotions, not our ability to get so worked up over something that we have the strength to fix it ourselves. 

We're meant to be slow to speak and slow to become angry because the anger of man doesn't earn the righteousness of God. I wanted to lean into the innocent and honest side of this song and my friend Niyah was such a tremendous help there. 

That's a professional way to say that she carried the song. 

But seriously, getting her help with the vulnerable and sweeping dynamic of this song was so huge. So grateful.

# GRAVITY
Gravity was the first song from Atlas that I dropped for y'all way back in January 2024, which feels like an eon ago. But looking back, I'm hopeful it was able to preview where this record was going in a fun and mysterious way. We're 15 songs into the album, and by this point, a lot of these lyrics might make a bit more sense. 

_I really hope._

We can't just drift in space, held loft by our own strength. We need to be held by something else. 

And we're not held by our own wisdom. We're not held by our own achievements. We're not held by our own accomplishments. We're held by Jesus. that same Jesus who holds all things together by the word of his power. And that's why we need to remember who he is. 

Even when we're falling into dawn and shadow, his love is the gravity that not only holds us, but keeps us moving. That's why faith is an orbit. I promised I'd talk to you all bout this. It's finally time. Let's do it.

Titan said that faith is an orbit. It's tension in motion that pulls you along to the end. When we approach faith, it's tempting to want to be fully grounded. Feet on the ground, nothing changing, nothing moving. But if Ecclesiastes is clear about anything, it's that change is inevitable under the sun. We can't be grounded like that.

So instead, we try to resist that change and end up drifting in space, not held in place by anything like in circles or undersun or inertia. We're left to ourselves. No authority, no purpose, no meaning. 

Vanity. 

That's why I think the picture of orbit is beautiful. It literally, physically, mathematically lives in tension. Think of the Earth orbiting the Sun. It's held in place, but it's moving, too. It experiences change, but it's always revolving around the same light of the same sun. And as the sun holds the earth, so Christ holds us. 

We experience summer and winter. We experience solitude and communion. We experience grief and joy. What gives the Christian joy is that Christ occupies the center of that orbit. What gives the Christian purpose is that Christ is the object of that orbit. That orbit is tension in motion. It's faith.

It's faith not just that God is sovereign, but faith that God is kind. It's falling and flying at the same time. It's being carried by the only one fit to carry us.

This is what it means to be alive.
# MAYFLY (feat. Xander Sallows)
So Xander and I have written like a ton of music. This is actually one of the only songs we've gotten to write in person before. So that was really fun. 

When I lived in central Arlington, mayfly season was really bad. Like every April, May, you'd have like a whole swarm of mayflies find their way into my house, crawl up onto my dining room table, stumble around for a little bit, and then spontaneously unalive just right there.

And the more mayfly corpses I swept up off the dining room floor, I'd go, "I'm not very different from them." This is the third time Ecclesiastes 3 shows up on Atlas. Instead of going, there's a time to live, a time to die. Mayfly says, "We may live, we may die, we may fall, we may fly." And on top of being a bad pun, it pays off the foreshadowing from Persephone and Tailspin that was shadowed.

Look, stuff is going to happen under the sun. Weeping, laughing, mourning, dancing, but events are the Lord's. Duties are ours and our duty is to do the next thing. Loving Jesus and doing what he says. 

All that's true even if the rough stuff happens that we're trying to prevent. That's what we're not really strangers was trying to say. Just because bad stuff could happen if we step out in obedience doesn't mean we just don't do it. That's why that language from strangers is there in the chorus. What if we drown? And sure, we might. We still have to exist somehow. And we still get to make the choice. 

I don't have enough time to sit and protect myself from tomorrow. I have one chance to live now. Right now.
# CRESCERE
This song gets its name from a Latin term that describes a growing circle. There's even a circle like in the background of the song. I 100% sat in my closet and read out like a ton of the digits of pi and they're just chilling in the background of the verses. 

On an album that's so concerned with circles, I needed to finally turn around and address the circle that I'm least comfortable talking about. My social circle. I thought I was better off alone, but that was just a lie. As this little ghostly bowed cymbal lets us know. 

And that's how we pivot back to STRANGERS again. If STRANGERS  was about the dark side of being alone, then CRESCERE, yeah, that's how you pronounce it, CRESCERE is about the hopeful side of embracing community. That's why the bridge goes back and uses the melody from STRANGERS. And I can't think of anything else interesting on uh....

Okay. Yeah. This is this is the croissant song. You win.
# HOW FIRM A FOUNDATION
This is an old hymn that was written anonymously in the 19th century. It has five verses. Just because I included four doesn't mean the other one isn't great. But it was the second verse that really gripped me. Christ will strengthen us, help us, and then what? 

Cause us to stand.

It's his strength and his strength all by itself that's enabled me to do the next thing. And I think that's beautiful. Some of you guys caught the instrumental after that third verse. That's the melody from my song Smoke at the very beginning of the whole story. 

God uses the flame of sanctifying trial to heal us and sharpen our affections for him, not to hurt us. That's hard to believe sometimes, sure, but the joy we'll get in Jesus is better than the joy we'll get by not ever feeling pain under the sun. It is all worth it in the end. 

Four years ago, Smoke said that in faith. Now, how firm a foundation says it in practice. It's the same truth experienced two way different ways. 

I sing the song with my church pretty often. It's why I included it here. 

In light of what CRESCERE talked about, there is just no chance I'm going to be strong enough to bear my cross without the help of those around me. And one of the ways God uses believers to bear each other's burdens is in the context of a healthy and strong local church. And so I wanted to be a signpost back to that with this song's inclusion.

# SUNDIAL KING
Sundial King is about Hezekiah, who is the king of Judah. This is a bit more obscure of a story. I'll give you the short version. 

Hezekiah was a good king of Judah, but he was still invaded by the evil Assyrians. And then he got sick, really sick. That was especially important because Hezekiah hadn't had a son yet. God had made a promise to Hezekiah's ancestor, David, that a descendant of his would one day reign on the throne forever. Clearly, there was something for Hezekiah to live for. He had a kingdom to protect and a family to preserve. Hezekiah could have given in to despair. Instead, he asked God for healing. And as a sign of favor, God caused the shadow on the steps of Ahaz to move backwards 10°.

Folks, he literally caused the sun to move backwards. And then Hezekiah was healed. 

Wild story. That's what the song is about

If you were listening really closely, we did foreshadow the song a couple of times. The first time was in Gods of Damascus with that piano line. 

Ahaz from Damascus is Hezekiah from Sundial's dad. Both of these guys faced pretty existential crises. Ahaz handled his in his own strength and pragmatism. Hezekiah was willing to rely on God's strength when it didn't make sense to. It's so tempting to look at our circumstances and say that we know better than to hope. That's just not true. 

And that's what Mayfly was about. That song foreshadowed Sundial too, right underneath the bad pun in the bridge. 

Why would I obey in faith when I might get hurt? I don't know what's going to happen. 

Neither did Hezekiah. But he was totally convinced that there was something to live for. I want you to have some hope that there's something to live for. Maybe you're listening and you're like, "Yeah, I was planning on that, so, thank you." But maybe you've tried too long to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders and it's left you just as it's left everyone else - hopeless. I know that's what it did to me. 

But in his kindness, God has put you where you are for a reason. Not for carrying the weight of the cosmos, but for trusting him to do that and in his strength doing the next thing. There's something to live for. I promise.

# LEGEND OF ATLAS
This is the climax of Atlas. It's the pinnacle of six years of thought and research and sweating and all of that stuff, and it's as abstract as the album it completes.

I'll admit that it was tempting to look at this piece as needing to fill some pretty big shoes. A lot of you have reached out over the past couple of years to chat about my other spoken word piece, A Ghost Story. It sounds like it resonated with a lot of you, and man, that blows my mind. Thank you. But to tell this story in the same way as that one would cheapen both of them. I think a ghost story was a solemn, refined, top-down look at salvation. I felt led toward an honest, existential, ground-up look at sanctification. And that would end up being the legend of Atlas. 

Just like the preacher shares his own experiences in the book of Ecclesiastes, this piece talks about the ways that I tried to chase after the wind, too. I tried to be self-sufficient. I tried to be braver and stronger and bolder and at the end of it, it was all smoke. It was all vanity. Never have I suffered more than when I've tried to bear the weight of controlling my circumstances, my reputation, and my destiny. The weight that the album compares to the weight of the planets. And the biggest reason why that's true is that in trying to bear that weight, I fundamentally don't get the Gospel. 

>"Thanks, God. I've got it from here. I liked the whole get out of hell free card. I've got a vague idea that you're in charge now of what I do, so I should probably behave. So, if you want me to do something, just let me know, but I'll take it from here." 

Friends, that is not the gospel. It will be the end of you. And it was almost the end of me. I missed the whole point. Not only did Jesus die for my sin, but he lives for my holiness.  You don't need my help. Who am I to help him? And who am I to take his place in carrying weight that I was never meant to carry? 

The good news of the Gospel is that Jesus can live in the tension when I can't. He is truly God and truly man. He was perfectly obedient and had perfect dominion over the universe and hung on a cross. He died for sinners like me who want to carry the cosmos. That messes with me, man. I know how undeserving of love I am. But that's where I actually need strength. True strength is believing the height, the width, the length, and the depth of Christ's love. 

And if I'm grounded in that infinite love, I can finally relinquish the weight of the planets. Not only that, but I have the strength to walk in obedience to what he wants me to do. That's my purpose, to love him and do what he says. And here we are. It's been a real generous 70 minutes of music for you. It was a couple years of hoping and dreaming for me. 

We're back at the paradox where we started. We end the album right where we began. Alone, I can't be strong. In Christ, I can't be weak. Over the most difficult years of my life, God showed me that I was in fact weak. And he showed me that I could in fact be strong. But only because he himself is strong. I don't have to be like Atlas, carrying the weight of my circumstances, my future, and my grief. Instead, I can lay that down, pick up my cross, and do the next thing. And just like the circles the album talks about so much Atlas has made its own circle ending with the same piano part that it began with. 

I need to stretch my legs. You've got stuff to do and I'm so grateful you're willing to sit with me and chat a little bit about my work. But it runs deeper than just being busy. You have something to live for today. Friend, I hope you comprehend the height and the length and the width and the depth of Christ's love for you. Only then will you be able to do the next thing. in his strength. Lay down the planets. Pick up your cross. Thanks for your time. Love you.
