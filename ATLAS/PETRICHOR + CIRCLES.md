Last time we talked, I promised you another story
And it's time I kept my word
It's different from the last one, but it's the same
And it starts in the rain
It starts in the pain
It starts with the need to be brave, mighty, stronger, bolder
But friends, I'm tired of holding the world on my shoulders

With all your streng—, streng—, st—, st—
With all your streng—

How did I get here among the stars?
Comatose, far from home
The hours I spend here all alone
Turn to months for all I know
I know that I'm stronger, don't you tell me I'm not
I can carry the cosmos along with my cross
Don't tell me I'm heartsick and I'm falling in circles
In circles, in circles
(This is too much)
