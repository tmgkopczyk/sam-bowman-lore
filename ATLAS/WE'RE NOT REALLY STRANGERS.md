"Why are you here? What do you want?
What's on your chest that hasn't been said by now?"
I wanna be free, free of the pain
Free of the thoughts I thought would be gone by now

Lock and key guarding me
A stronghold formed in terror
Fortified, cold inside
But safe from looming danger

We're not really strangers
The length of my arm hasn't promised me safety
I understand that no man is an island
Whether I drown in the sea or the silence
We're not really strangers
I wanna be strong but I'm tired of faking
Help me to face what I'm truly afraid of
Trusting in man or the Master that made us

How do I leave? Where do I go?
The weight of the stress has gotten the best of me
Maybe the fear of opening up, of showing my cards
Has brought me more harm than peace

Lock and key guarding me
From those who'd truly know me
Full of pride, cold inside
And tired of feeling lonely

We're not really strangers
The length of my arm hasn't promised me safety
I understand that no man is an island
Whether I drown in the sea or the silence
We're not really strangers
I wanna move on but I don't have the bravery
Help me to face what I'm truly afraid of
Trusting in man or the Master that made us

I'm coming to terms with my dream
For me to escape your notice
I'm coming to terms with my need
For You to bear the load 'cause
The weight of the world is far too much
For me to carry all at once

We're not really strangers
The length of my arm hasn't promised me safety
I understand that no man is an island
Whether I drown in the sea or the silence
We're not really strangers
I wanna be strong but I'm tired of faking
Help me to face what I'm truly afraid of
Trusting in man or the Master that made us
Can you remind me we're not really strangers?
