Don't get the wrong idea
I make a living acting tough
But I'm under siege from without and within
Such is love, such is war, and the other stuff
Setting affairs in order
I should accept the prophet's words
The fire inside wants to say I'll be fine
I won't lie, you and I, we know better now

"But does that have to be my story?"
My bedroom wall can hear me say
"Remember how I walked before You
By Your strength?"

I won't pretend my questioning
Could change Your sovereign rule
But maybe tearful wrestling
Is how You'll make me new

Can You harness the sun and draw it backwards
Just a few degrees?
Can You capture the cosmos' shifting shadows
Far beyond my reach?
There's something to live for, joy in Your plan
I'll watch from the window, wait for an answer
The cosmos are shifting backwards
You're not done with me

We're all victims of physics under the sun
We live in the prison that hubris becomes
We're twisted and bitter
Believing the lie, you and I, we know better now

"But does that have to be my story?"
My bedroom wall can hear me say
"Remember how I walked before You
By Your strength?"

'Cause maybe Your deliverance
Will make me understand
If grace has made me who I am
Then grace will help me stand

Can You harness the sun and draw it backwards
Just a few degrees?
Can You capture the cosmos' shifting shadows
Far beyond my reach?
There's something to live for, joy in Your plan
I'll watch from the window, wait for an answer
The cosmos are shifting backwards
You're not done with me

There's something to live for, help me to see
Just like You convinced the sundial king
The cosmos are shifting backwards
And You're not done with me
