From an old English parsonage down by the sea
There came in the twilight a message to me
Its time-honored legend, deeply engraven
Carried, it seems to me, teaching from heaven
And on through the doorway the quiet words ring
Like a low inspiration: "do the next thing"

Many a questioning, many a fear
Many a doubt find their quieting here
Moment by moment, let down from the heavens
Time, opportunity, and guidance are given
Fear not tomorrows, child of the King
Trust them with Jesus; do the next thing

So do it immediately, do it with prayer
Do it reliantly, casting all care (Casting all care)
Do it with reverence, tracing His hand
Who placed it before you with earnest command
Stayed on omnipotence, safe 'neath His wing
Leave all resultingâ€”do the next thing

Looking to Jesus, ever serene
Working or suffering, hold your belief
In His dear presence, the rest of His calm
The light of His countenance will be your psalm
Strong in His faithfulness, worship and sing
Then, as He beckons you, do the next thing

So lay down the planets
And pick up your cross
And do the next thing
