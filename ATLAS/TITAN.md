Grief is a circle, wander 'round it
To notice the ending is where you began
Time is a fulcrum prying you forward
And all you can do is give in
Faith is an orbit, it's tension in motion
That pulls you along to the end
And I'm on that tightrope, grasping at stars
As I sway back and forth over the edge

Change is a promise that's given
To anyone sojourning under the sun
My thoughts are in boxes, it's the best I can do
To accept what my mindset's become
The cosmos are shifting, my feelings are, too
And I'm trying to hold them in place
So I can control all the chaos
And make you believe that I'm doing okay

I wish I were larger than life
That my heart and my mind
Could decide on my purpose for once
My shoulders are straining, but I'd rather believe
That gravity's no match for me

So I'll hold the planets, along with your hand
And I'll hope you won't notice I don't understand
The weight of the stars and such
But I promise it's not too much
Do you see a Titan? I sure hope you do
'Cause my heart is so frightened that you'll see right through
The struggle to keep this up
But I promise it's not too much
It's not too much

What if I crash?
I swear that I won't, but I might and I'm scared
What if I'm crushed?
Underneath all the weight of my questions and cares
And my struggles and pain and convictions and grief
And commitments and purpose and meaning and calling
And fear that the fire within me has died
And the feeling that I was the ghost this whole time
Breathing the lie that I desperately want you to buy
I can carry the cosmos along with my cross
But I'm pulling both sides of that pulley
'Til it pulls me asunder

I wish were larger than life
That my heart and my mind
Could decide on my purpose for once
My courage is failing to make you believe
That gravity's no match for me (Gravity's no match for me)

So I'll hold the planets to prove that I can
And I'll hope you won't notice I don't understand
The weight of the stars and such
But I promise it's not too much, not too much, too much

But that won't stop the fragments of Saturn from crashing down onto my head
I should have expected this, I asked for this
And that's when a voice says He'll bear it instead
And take hold of the galaxies that shackle me
And He tells me that this part is out of my hands
And He'll help me believe Him

'Cause He's held the planets since He hung them in space
Just as He holds you and I in his grace
And for Jesus, it's not too much
'Cause I'm not a Titan, and I never was
But we don't need Titans to do Jesus' job
True strength is believing the height and the length
And the width and the depth of His love

Grief is a circle, wander 'round it
In hope that He's stronger than you could believe
