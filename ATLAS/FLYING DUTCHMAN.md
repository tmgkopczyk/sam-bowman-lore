Set a course for the heart of the storm
And from starboard to port raise the sails
We both know that the sea is my home
And some weather won't get in my way

I'm a message in a bottle
A treasure underwater
Suspended and resting in place
So set a course for the heart of the storm
I'll do anything, anything but change

But we're going under
The wind and the waves, the crippling change
Will pull us asunder
Sure as the sun will rise
We're falling behind in a race against time and
I can't help but try to keep this moment alive
'Cause I love it too much to put to port and let it die

Hoist the mainsail, we don't have all day
Our fortune's at stake, don't you know?
What have we become underneath the sun?
Rudderless and sunk, unaware we are
Victims of physics below

I want to tell you I'm Poseidon
Tell you I'm a Titan
But time's just beyond my control
But it's not beyond He who commands all the seas
And the waves that must carry us home

But we're going under
The wind and the waves, the crippling change
Will pull us asunder
Sure as the sun will rise
We're falling behind in a race against time and
I can't help but try to keep this moment alive
'Cause I love it too much to put to port and let it die

We're falling behind in a race against time so
I'll hold up the sky to keep the planets aligned

So set a course for the long journey home
And from starboard to port raise the sails
'Cause there's hope in surrender, joy in the measure
Of memories yet to be made
